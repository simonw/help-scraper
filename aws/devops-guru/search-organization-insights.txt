SEARCH-ORGANIZATION-INSIGHTS()                  SEARCH-ORGANIZATION-INSIGHTS()



NAME
       search-organization-insights -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of insights in your organization. You can specify which
       insights are returned by their start time, one or more statuses  (ONGO-
       ING , CLOSED , and CLOSED ), one or more severities (LOW , MEDIUM , and
       HIGH ), and type (REACTIVE or PROACTIVE ).

       Use the Filters parameter to specify status and severity search parame-
       ters.  Use  the Type parameter to specify REACTIVE or PROACTIVE in your
       search.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-organization-insights is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: ProactiveInsights, ReactiveInsights

          ResourceCollection -> (structure)
              A  collection  of Amazon Web Services resources supported by De-
              vOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource collec-
              tions  supported  are  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks
              and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the  same  Amazon
              Web  Services  tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the
              Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks  or
              that  are  tagged using the same tag key . You can specify up to
              500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

              CloudFormation -> (structure)
                 An array of the names of Amazon Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.  The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources that
                 DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web
                 Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 StackNames -> (list)
                     An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                     (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services tags that are used by resources in
                 the resource collection.

                 Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Services
                 resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging,
                 so you can assign the same tag to  resources  from  different
                 services  to indicate that the resources are related. For ex-
                 ample, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB  ta-
                 ble  resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more
                 information about using tags, see the Tagging best  practices
                 whitepaper.

                 Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                 o A  tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project
                   , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 o An optional field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for  example,
                   111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting the
                   tag value is the same as using an empty  string.  Like  tag
                   keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                 Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your resource coverage must begin  with  the  prefix  De-
                     vops-guru-  .  The  tag  key might be Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application  .  While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter to DevOps Guru. For  example,  DevOps  Guru  works
                     with  a  key  named  devops-guru-rds  and a key named De-
                     vOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value pairs in your  appli-
                     cation might be Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS or
                     Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru-  .  The  tag key might be Devops-guru-de-
                        ployment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application  .
                        While keys are case-sensitive, the case of key charac-
                        ters don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example,  DevOps
                        Guru  works with a key named devops-guru-rds and a key
                        named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value  pairs  in
                        your  application  might be Devops-Guru-production-ap-
                        plication/RDS    or    Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                        tion/containers .

                     AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                        An  Amazon  Web Services tag key that is used to iden-
                        tify the Amazon Web  Services  resources  that  DevOps
                        Guru  analyzes.  All  Amazon Web Services resources in
                        your account and Region tagged with this key  make  up
                        your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

                        WARNING:
                            The string used for a key in a tag that you use to
                            define your resource coverage must begin with  the
                            prefix  Devops-guru-  .  The  tag key might be De-
                            vops-guru-deployment-application      or       De-
                            vops-guru-rds-application   .   While   keys   are
                            case-sensitive, the case of key  characters  don't
                            matter  to  DevOps  Guru. For example, DevOps Guru
                            works with a key named devops-guru-rds and  a  key
                            named  DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value pairs
                            in your application might  be  Devops-Guru-produc-

                            plication/containers .

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production , or a team name). The key  and  value  are
                        the tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same
                        as using an empty string. Like tag keys ,  tag  values
                        are  case-sensitive.  You can specify a maximum of 256
                        characters for a tag value.

                        (string)

          ServiceCollection -> (structure)
              A collection of the names of Amazon Web Services services.

              ServiceNames -> (list)
                 An array of strings that each specifies the name of an Amazon
                 Web Services service.

                 (string)

            }
          }

       --type (string)
          The type of insights you are searching for (REACTIVE or PROACTIVE ).

          Possible values:

          o REACTIVE

          o PROACTIVE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              PredictionTimeRange -> (structure)
                 The time range during which anomalous behavior in a proactive
                 anomaly or an insight is expected to occur.

                 StartTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time range during which a metric limit is expected to
                     be exceeded. This applies to proactive insights only.

                 EndTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when the behavior in a proactive insight is  ex-
                     pected to end.

              ResourceCollection -> (structure)
                 A  collection  of  Amazon Web Services resources supported by
                 DevOps Guru. The two types of Amazon  Web  Services  resource
                 collections  supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks and Amazon Web Services  resources  that  contain  the
                 same  Amazon  Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be configured
                 to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
                 in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You
                 can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.

                 CloudFormation -> (structure)
                     An  array of the names of Amazon Web Services CloudForma-
                     tion stacks. The stacks define Amazon  Web  Services  re-
                     sources  that DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to
                     500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services tags that are used  by  resources
                     in the resource collection.

                     Tags  help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices resources. Many Amazon Web Services  services  sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from different services to indicate  that  the  resources
                     are  related. For example, you can assign the same tag to
                     an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign  to  an
                     Lambda  function.  For more information about using tags,
                     see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

                     Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                     o A tag key (for  example,  CostCenter  ,  Environment  ,
                       Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                        Tags help you identify and organize  your  Amazon  Web
                        Services  resources. Many Amazon Web Services services
                        support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to re-
                        sources  from  different services to indicate that the
                        resources are related. For example, you can assign the
                        same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you
                        assign to an Lambda  function.  For  more  information

                            111122223333 , Production , or a team  name).  The
                            key and value are the tag's key pair. Omitting the
                            tag value is the same as using  an  empty  string.
                            Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive. You
                            can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a  tag
                            value.
