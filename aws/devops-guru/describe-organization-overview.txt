OPTIONS
       --from-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time range passed in. The start time granularity is

       --to-time (timestamp)
          The  end  of the time range passed in. The start time granularity is
          at the day level. The floor of the start time is used. Returned  in-
          formation  occurred  before this day. If this is not specified, then
          the current day is used.

       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

          (string)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
