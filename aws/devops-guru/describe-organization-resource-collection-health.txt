NAME
       describe-organization-resource-collection-health -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  an overview of your system's health. If additional member ac-
       counts are part of your organization, you can filter those accounts us-
       ing the AccountIds field.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-organization-resource-collection-health  is a paginated opera-
       tion. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire
       data  set  of  results.  You  can  disable  pagination by providing the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment  on  a  paginated response, the --query argument must extract data
       from the results of the following  query  expressions:  CloudFormation,
       Account, Service, Tags

OPTIONS
       --organization-resource-collection-type (string)
          An Amazon Web Services resource collection type. This type specifies
          how analyzed Amazon Web Services  resources  are  defined.  The  two
          types of Amazon Web Services resource collections supported are Ama-
          zon Web Services CloudFormation stacks and Amazon Web  Services  re-
          sources  that  contain the same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru
          can be configured to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources  that
          are  defined in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key
          . You can specify up  to  500  Amazon  Web  Services  CloudFormation
          stacks.

          Possible values:

          o AWS_CLOUD_FORMATION

          o AWS_SERVICE

          o AWS_ACCOUNT

          o AWS_TAGS

       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --organizational-unit-ids (list)
          The ID of the organizational unit.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of results to return with a single call. To re-
          trieve the remaining results, make another call  with  the  returned
          nextToken value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       Tags -> (list)
          Tags  help  you  identify  and organize your Amazon Web Services re-
          sources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging,  so  you
          can  assign the same tag to resources from different services to in-
          dicate that the resources are related. For example, you  can  assign
          the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to
          an Lambda function. For more information about using tags,  see  the
          Tagging best practices whitepaper.

          Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

          o A  tag  key  (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project , or
            Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

          o An optional field known as a tag value (for example,  111122223333
            , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same
            as using an empty string. Like tag keys , tag values are case-sen-
            sitive.

          Together these are known as key -value pairs.

          WARNING:
              The  string  used for a key in a tag that you use to define your
              resource coverage must begin with the prefix Devops-guru- .  The
              tag  key  might  be  Devops-guru-deployment-application  or  De-
              vops-guru-rds-application . While keys are  case-sensitive,  the
              case of key characters don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example,
              DevOps Guru works with a key named  devops-guru-rds  and  a  key
              named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value pairs in your appli-
              cation might be  Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS  or  De-
              vops-Guru-production-application/containers .

          (structure)
              Information about the health of Amazon Web Services resources in
              your account that are specified by an Amazon  Web  Services  tag
              key .

              AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                 An  Amazon  Web Services tag key that is used to identify the
                 Amazon Web Services resources that DevOps Guru analyzes.  All
                 Amazon  Web  Services  resources  in  your account and Region
                 tagged with this key make up your DevOps Guru application and
                 analysis boundary.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your resource coverage must begin  with  the  prefix  De-
                     vops-guru-  .  The  tag  key might be Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application  .  While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter to DevOps Guru. For  example,  DevOps  Guru  works
                     with  a  key  named  devops-guru-rds  and a key named De-
                     vOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value pairs in your  appli-
                     cation might be Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS or
                     Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

              TagValue -> (string)
                 The value in an Amazon Web Services tag.

                 The tag's value is an optional  field  used  to  associate  a
                 string  with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 , Produc-
                 tion , or a team name). The key and value are the  tag's  key
                 pair.  Omitting  the  tag value is the same as using an empty
                 string. Like tag keys , tag values  are  case-sensitive.  You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

              Insight -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the health of the Amazon Web Services re-
                 sources in your account that are specified by an  Amazon  Web
                 Services  tag,  including  the number of open proactive, open
                 reactive insights, and the Mean Time  to  Recover  (MTTR)  of
                 closed insights.

                 OpenProactiveInsights -> (integer)
                     The number of open proactive insights.

                 OpenReactiveInsights -> (integer)
                     The number of open reactive insights.

                 MeanTimeToRecoverInMilliseconds -> (long)
                     The Meant Time to Recover (MTTR) for the insight.
