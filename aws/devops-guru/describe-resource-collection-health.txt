NAME
       describe-resource-collection-health -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the number of open proactive insights, open reactive insights,
       and the Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) for all closed insights in resource
       collections  in  your  account. You specify the type of Amazon Web Ser-
       vices resources collection. The two types of Amazon  Web  Services  re-
       source  collections  supported  are  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
       stacks and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the  same  Amazon
       Web  Services  tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the Amazon
       Web Services resources that are defined  in  the  stacks  or  that  are
       tagged  using  the  same tag key . You can specify up to 500 Amazon Web
       Services CloudFormation stacks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-resource-collection-health is a paginated operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: CloudFormation, Service, Tags

SYNOPSIS
            describe-resource-collection-health
          --resource-collection-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-collection-type (string)
          An Amazon Web Services resource collection type. This type specifies
          how analyzed Amazon Web Services  resources  are  defined.  The  two
          types of Amazon Web Services resource collections supported are Ama-
          zon Web Services CloudFormation stacks and Amazon Web  Services  re-
          sources  that  contain the same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru
          can be configured to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources  that
          are  defined in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key
          . You can specify up  to  500  Amazon  Web  Services  CloudFormation
          stacks.

          Possible values:

          o AWS_CLOUD_FORMATION

          o AWS_SERVICE

          o AWS_TAGS

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Tags -> (list)
          The  Amazon  Web Services tags that are used by resources in the re-
          source collection.

          Tags help you identify and organize your  Amazon  Web  Services  re-
          sources.  Many  Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you
          can assign the same tag to resources from different services to  in-
          dicate  that  the resources are related. For example, you can assign
          the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to
          an  Lambda  function. For more information about using tags, see the
          Tagging best practices whitepaper.

          Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

          o A tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment ,  Project  ,  or
            Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

          o An  optional field known as a tag value (for example, 111122223333
            , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same
            as using an empty string. Like tag keys , tag values are case-sen-
            sitive.

          Together these are known as key -value pairs.

          WARNING:
              The string used for a key in a tag that you use to  define  your
              resource  coverage must begin with the prefix Devops-guru- . The
              tag  key  might  be  Devops-guru-deployment-application  or  De-
              vops-guru-rds-application  .  While keys are case-sensitive, the
              case of key characters don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example,
              DevOps  Guru  works  with  a key named devops-guru-rds and a key
              named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value pairs in your appli-
              cation  might  be  Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS or De-
              vops-Guru-production-application/containers .

          (structure)
              Information about the health of Amazon Web Services resources in
              your  account  that  are specified by an Amazon Web Services tag
              key .

              AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                 An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used to  identify  the
                 Amazon  Web Services resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. All
                 Amazon Web Services resources  in  your  account  and  Region
                 tagged with this key make up your DevOps Guru application and
                 analysis boundary.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your  resource  coverage  must  begin with the prefix De-
                     vops-guru- . The tag  key  might  be  Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application  or  Devops-guru-rds-application . While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter  to  DevOps  Guru.  For example, DevOps Guru works
                     with a key named devops-guru-rds  and  a  key  named  De-
                     vOps-Guru-RDS  . Possible key /value pairs in your appli-
                     cation might be Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS or
                     Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

              TagValue -> (string)
                 The value in an Amazon Web Services tag.

                 The  tag's  value  is  an  optional field used to associate a
                 string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,  Produc-
                 tion  ,  or a team name). The key and value are the tag's key
                 pair. Omitting the tag value is the same as  using  an  empty
                 string.  Like  tag  keys , tag values are case-sensitive. You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

              Insight -> (structure)
                 Information about the health of the Amazon Web  Services  re-
                 sources  in  your account that are specified by an Amazon Web
                 Services tag, including the number of  open  proactive,  open
                 reactive  insights,  and  the  Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) of
                 closed insights.

                 OpenProactiveInsights -> (integer)
                     The number of open proactive insights.

                 OpenReactiveInsights -> (integer)
                     The number of open reactive insights.

                 MeanTimeToRecoverInMilliseconds -> (long)
                     The Meant Time to Recover (MTTR) for the insight.
