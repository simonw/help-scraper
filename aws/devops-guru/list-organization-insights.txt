LIST-ORGANIZATION-INSIGHTS()                      LIST-ORGANIZATION-INSIGHTS()



NAME
       list-organization-insights -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of insights associated with the account or OU Id.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-organization-insights is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ProactiveInsights, ReactiveInsights

            },
            "Closed": {
              "Type": "REACTIVE"|"PROACTIVE",
              "EndTimeRange": {
                "FromTime": timestamp,
                "ToTime": timestamp
              }
            },
            "Any": {

              }
            }
          }

       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --organizational-unit-ids (list)
          The ID of the organizational unit.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              ResourceCollection -> (structure)
                 A collection of Amazon Web Services  resources  supported  by
                 DevOps  Guru.  The  two types of Amazon Web Services resource
                 collections supported are Amazon Web Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks  and  Amazon  Web  Services resources that contain the
                 same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can  be  configured
                 to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
                 in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You
                 can  specify  up  to  500  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks.

                 CloudFormation -> (structure)
                     An array of the names of Amazon Web Services  CloudForma-
                     tion  stacks.  The  stacks define Amazon Web Services re-
                     sources that DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up  to
                     500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The  Amazon  Web Services tags that are used by resources
                     in the resource collection.

                     Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices  resources.  Many Amazon Web Services services sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from  different  services  to indicate that the resources
                     are related. For example, you can assign the same tag  to
                     an  Amazon  DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an
                     Lambda function. For more information about  using  tags,
                     see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

                     Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                     o A  tag  key  (for  example,  CostCenter , Environment ,
                       Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                     o An optional field known as a tag  value  (for  example,
                       111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting
                       the tag value is the same as  using  an  empty  string.
                       Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                     Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru-  .  The  tag key might be Devops-guru-de-
                        ployment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application  .
                        While keys are case-sensitive, the case of key charac-
                        ters don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example,  DevOps
                        Guru  works with a key named devops-guru-rds and a key
                        named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value  pairs  in
                        your  application  might be Devops-Guru-production-ap-
                        plication/RDS    or    Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                        tion/containers .

                        A collection of Amazon Web Services stags.

                        Tags  help  you  identify and organize your Amazon Web
                        Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services  services
                        support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to re-
                        sources from different services to indicate  that  the
                        resources are related. For example, you can assign the
                        same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you
                        assign  to  an  Lambda  function. For more information
                        about using  tags,  see  the  Tagging  best  practices

                 EndTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when the behavior described in an insight ended.

              ResourceCollection -> (structure)
                 A  collection  of  Amazon Web Services resources supported by
                 DevOps Guru. The two types of Amazon  Web  Services  resource
                 collections  supported are Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks and Amazon Web Services  resources  that  contain  the
                 same  Amazon  Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can be configured
                 to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
                 in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You
                 can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.

                 CloudFormation -> (structure)
                     An  array of the names of Amazon Web Services CloudForma-
                     tion stacks. The stacks define Amazon  Web  Services  re-
                     sources  that DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to
                     500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services tags that are used  by  resources
                     in the resource collection.

                     Tags  help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices resources. Many Amazon Web Services  services  sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from different services to indicate  that  the  resources
                     are  related. For example, you can assign the same tag to
                     an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign  to  an
                     Lambda  function.  For more information about using tags,
                     see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

                     Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                     o A tag key (for  example,  CostCenter  ,  Environment  ,
                       Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                     o An  optional  field  known as a tag value (for example,
                       111122223333 , Production , or a team  name).  Omitting
                       the  tag  value  is  the same as using an empty string.
                       Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                     Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru- . The tag key  might  be  Devops-guru-de-
                        ployment-application  or Devops-guru-rds-application .
                        While keys are case-sensitive, the case of key charac-
                        ters  don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps
                        Guru works with a key named devops-guru-rds and a  key
                        named  DevOps-Guru-RDS  . Possible key /value pairs in
                        your application might  be  Devops-Guru-production-ap-
                        plication/RDS    or    Devops-Guru-production-applica-

                        Tags help you identify and organize  your  Amazon  Web
                        Services  resources. Many Amazon Web Services services
                        support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to re-
                        sources  from  different services to indicate that the
                        resources are related. For example, you can assign the
                        same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you
                        assign to an Lambda  function.  For  more  information
                        about  using  tags,  see  the  Tagging  best practices
