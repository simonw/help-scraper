LIST-ANOMALIES-FOR-INSIGHT()                      LIST-ANOMALIES-FOR-INSIGHT()



NAME
       list-anomalies-for-insight -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  the  anomalies that belong to an insight that you
       specify using its ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-anomalies-for-insight is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ReactiveAnomalies, ProactiveAnomalies

OPTIONS
       --insight-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  insight. The returned anomalies belong to this in-
          sight.

       --start-time-range (structure)
          A time range used to specify when the requested  anomalies  started.
          All returned anomalies started during this time range.

          FromTime -> (timestamp)
              The start time of the time range.

          ToTime -> (timestamp)
              The end time of the time range.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FromTime=timestamp,ToTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FromTime": timestamp,
            "ToTime": timestamp
          }

       --account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                        Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor
                        and explore  different  dimensions  of  database  load
                        based  on data captured from a running DB instance. DB
                        load is measured as average active  sessions.  Perfor-
                        mance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
                        two-dimensional time-series dataset. The  time  dimen-
                        sion  provides DB load data for each time point in the
                        queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall
                        load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured
                        at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait  event,
                        User, and Host.

                        MetricDisplayName -> (string)
                            The name used for a specific Performance  Insights
                            metric.

                        Unit -> (string)
                            The  unit  of measure for a metric. For example, a
                            session or a process.

                        MetricQuery -> (structure)
                            A single query to be processed for the metric. For
                            more          information,          see         ``
                            PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery `` .

                            Metric -> (string)
                               The name of the meteric used used when querying
                               an  Performance Insights GetResourceMetrics API
                               for anomaly metrics.

                               Valid values for Metric are:

                               o db.load.avg - a scaled representation of  the
                                 number  of  active  sessions for the database
                                 engine.

                               o db.sampledload.avg - the raw number of active
                                 sessions for the database engine.

                               If  the  number of active sessions is less than
                               an  internal  Performance  Insights  threshold,
                               db.load.avg and db.sampledload.avg are the same
                               value. If the  number  of  active  sessions  is
                               greater  than  the  internal threshold, Perfor-
                               mance Insights  samples  the  active  sessions,
                               with  db.load.avg  showing  the  scaled values,
                               db.sampledload.avg showing the raw values,  and
                               db.sampledload.avg  less than db.load.avg . For
                               most use cases, you can query db.load.avg only.

                            GroupBy -> (structure)
                               The specification for how to aggregate the data
                               points from a Performance Insights GetResource-
                               Metrics API  query.  The  Performance  Insights
                               query returns all of the dimensions within that
                               group, unless you provide the names of specific
                               dimensions  within that group. You can also re-
                               quest that Performance Insights return  a  lim-
                               ited number of values for a dimension.

                     500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services tags that are used  by  resources
                     in the resource collection.

                     Tags  help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices resources. Many Amazon Web Services  services  sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from different services to indicate  that  the  resources
                     are  related. For example, you can assign the same tag to
                     an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign  to  an
                     Lambda  function.  For more information about using tags,
                     see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

                     Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                     o A tag key (for  example,  CostCenter  ,  Environment  ,
                       Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                     o An  optional  field  known as a tag value (for example,
                       111122223333 , Production , or a team  name).  Omitting
                       the  tag  value  is  the same as using an empty string.
                       Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                     Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru- . The tag key  might  be  Devops-guru-de-
                        ployment-application  or Devops-guru-rds-application .
                        While keys are case-sensitive, the case of key charac-
                        ters  don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example, DevOps
                        Guru works with a key named devops-guru-rds and a  key
                        named  DevOps-Guru-RDS  . Possible key /value pairs in
                        your application might  be  Devops-Guru-production-ap-

                        Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor
                        and  explore  different  dimensions  of  database load
                        based on data captured from a running DB instance.  DB
                        load  is  measured as average active sessions. Perfor-
                        mance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
                        two-dimensional  time-series  dataset. The time dimen-
                        sion provides DB load data for each time point in  the
                        queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall
                        load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured
                        at  that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event,

                        MetricQuery -> (structure)
                            A single query to be processed for the metric. For
                            more         information,          see          ``

                            Metric -> (string)
                               The name of the meteric used used when querying
                               an Performance Insights GetResourceMetrics  API
                               for anomaly metrics.

                               Valid values for Metric are:

                               o db.load.avg  - a scaled representation of the
                                 number of active sessions  for  the  database
                                 engine.

                               o db.sampledload.avg - the raw number of active
                                 sessions for the database engine.

                               If the number of active sessions is  less  than
                               an  internal  Performance  Insights  threshold,
                               db.load.avg and db.sampledload.avg are the same
                               value.  If  the  number  of  active sessions is
                               greater than the  internal  threshold,  Perfor-
                               mance  Insights  samples  the  active sessions,
                               with db.load.avg  showing  the  scaled  values,
                               db.sampledload.avg  showing the raw values, and
                               db.sampledload.avg less than db.load.avg .  For
                               most use cases, you can query db.load.avg only.

                               group, unless you provide the names of specific
                               dimensions within that group. You can also  re-
                               quest  that  Performance Insights return a lim-
                               ited number of values for a dimension.

                            anomalous. When DevOps Guru analyzes  metrics,  it
                            compares them to StatsAtBaseline to help determine
                            if they are anomalous.

              ResourceCollection -> (structure)
                 A collection of Amazon Web Services  resources  supported  by
                 DevOps  Guru.  The  two types of Amazon Web Services resource
                 collections supported are Amazon Web Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks  and  Amazon  Web  Services resources that contain the
                 same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can  be  configured
                 to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
                 in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You
                 can  specify  up  to  500  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks.

                 CloudFormation -> (structure)
                     An array of the names of Amazon Web Services  CloudForma-
                     tion  stacks.  The  stacks define Amazon Web Services re-
                     sources that DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up  to
                     500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The  Amazon  Web Services tags that are used by resources
                     in the resource collection.

                     Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices  resources.  Many Amazon Web Services services sup-
                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from  different  services  to indicate that the resources
                     are related. For example, you can assign the same tag  to
                     an  Amazon  DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an
                     Lambda function. For more information about  using  tags,
                     see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

                     Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                     o A  tag  key  (for  example,  CostCenter , Environment ,
                       Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                     o An optional field known as a tag  value  (for  example,
                       111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting
                       the tag value is the same as  using  an  empty  string.
                       Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                     Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru-  .  The  tag key might be Devops-guru-de-
                        ployment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application  .
                        While keys are case-sensitive, the case of key charac-
                        ters don't matter to DevOps Guru. For example,  DevOps
                        Guru  works with a key named devops-guru-rds and a key
                        named DevOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value  pairs  in
                        your  application  might be Devops-Guru-production-ap-
                        plication/RDS    or    Devops-Guru-production-applica-

                        Tags  help  you  identify and organize your Amazon Web
                        Services resources. Many Amazon Web Services  services
                        support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to re-
                        sources from different services to indicate  that  the
                        resources are related. For example, you can assign the
                        same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you
                        assign  to  an  Lambda  function. For more information
                        about using  tags,  see  the  Tagging  best  practices
