LIST-EVENTS()                                                    LIST-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the events emitted by the resources that are evalu-
       ated by DevOps Guru. You can use filters to specify  which  events  are
       returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-events  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Events

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          A ListEventsFilters object used to specify which events to return.

          InsightId -> (string)
              An ID of an insight that is related to the events  you  want  to
              filter for.

          EventTimeRange -> (structure)
              A  time  range during which you want the filtered events to have
              occurred.

              FromTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the event started.

              ToTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the event ended.

          EventClass -> (string)
              The class of the events you want to filter for, such as  an  in-
              frastructure change, a deployment, or a schema change.

          EventSource -> (string)
              The  Amazon Web Services source that emitted the events you want
              to filter for.

          DataSource -> (string)
              The source, AWS_CLOUD_TRAIL or AWS_CODE_DEPLOY , of  the  events
              you want returned.

          ResourceCollection -> (structure)
              A  collection  of Amazon Web Services resources supported by De-
              vOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource collec-
              tions  supported  are  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks
              and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the  same  Amazon
              Web  Services  tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the
              Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks  or
              that  are  tagged using the same tag key . You can specify up to
              500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

              CloudFormation -> (structure)
                 An array of the names of Amazon Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.  The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources that
                 DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web
                 Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 StackNames -> (list)
                     An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                     (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services tags that are used by resources in
                 the resource collection.

                 Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Services
                 resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging,
                 so you can assign the same tag to  resources  from  different
                 services  to indicate that the resources are related. For ex-
                 ample, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB  ta-
                 ble  resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more
                 information about using tags, see the Tagging best  practices
                 whitepaper.

                 Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                 o A  tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project
                   , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 o An optional field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for  example,
                   111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting the
                   tag value is the same as using an empty  string.  Like  tag
                   keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                 Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your resource coverage must begin  with  the  prefix  De-
                     vops-guru-  .  The  tag  key might be DevOps-Guru-deploy-
                     ment-application or  devops-guru-rds-application  .  When
                     you  create a key , the case of characters in the key can
                     be whatever you choose. After you create a key  ,  it  is
                     case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a key
                     named devops-guru-rds and a key named  DevOps-Guru-RDS  ,
                     and these act as two different keys . Possible key /value
                     pairs in your application  might  be  Devops-Guru-produc-
                     tion-application/RDS  or  Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                     tion/containers .

                     port tagging, so you can assign the same tag to resources
                     from  different  services  to indicate that the resources
                     are related. For example, you can assign the same tag  to
                     an  Amazon  DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an
                     Lambda function. For more information about  using  tags,

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru-  .  The  tag key might be DevOps-Guru-de-
                        ployment-application or devops-guru-rds-application  .
                        When  you create a key , the case of characters in the
                        key can be whatever you choose. After you create a key
                        , it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works
                        with a key named devops-guru-rds and a key  named  De-
                        vOps-Guru-RDS  , and these act as two different keys .
                        Possible key /value pairs in your application might be
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or     De-

                     AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                        An Amazon Web Services tag key that is used  to  iden-
                        tify  the  Amazon  Web  Services resources that DevOps
                        Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web  Services  resources  in
                        your  account  and Region tagged with this key make up
                        your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

                        WARNING:
                            The string used for a key in a tag that you use to
                            define  your resource coverage must begin with the
                            prefix Devops-guru- . The tag  key  might  be  De-
                            vOps-Guru-deployment-application       or      de-
                            vops-guru-rds-application . When you create a  key
                            ,  the  case of characters in the key can be what-
                            ever you choose. After you create a key  ,  it  is
                            case-sensitive.  For  example,  DevOps  Guru works
                            with a key named devops-guru-rds and a  key  named
                            DevOps-Guru-RDS  ,  and these act as two different
                            keys . Possible key /value pairs in your  applica-

                            tion/containers .

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production  ,  or  a team name). The key and value are
                        the tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same
                        as  using  an empty string. Like tag keys , tag values
                        are case-sensitive. You can specify a maximum  of  256
                        characters for a tag value.

                        (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InsightId": "string",
            "EventTimeRange": {
              "FromTime": timestamp,
              "ToTime": timestamp
            },
            "EventClass": "INFRASTRUCTURE"|"DEPLOYMENT"|"SECURITY_CHANGE"|"CONFIG_CHANGE"|"SCHEMA_CHANGE",
            "EventSource": "string",
            "DataSource": "AWS_CLOUD_TRAIL"|"AWS_CODE_DEPLOY",
            "ResourceCollection": {
              "CloudFormation": {
                "StackNames": ["string", ...]
              },
              "Tags": [
                {
                  "AppBoundaryKey": "string",
                  "TagValues": ["string", ...]
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
          }

       --account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       Events -> (list)
          A list of the requested events.

          (structure)
              An  Amazon  Web Services resource event. Amazon Web Services re-
              source events and metrics are analyzed by DevOps  Guru  to  find
              anomalous  behavior  and provide recommendations to improve your
              operational solutions.

              ResourceCollection -> (structure)
                 A collection of Amazon Web Services  resources  supported  by

                 collections supported are Amazon Web Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks  and  Amazon  Web  Services resources that contain the
                 same Amazon Web Services tag. DevOps Guru can  be  configured
                 to analyze the Amazon Web Services resources that are defined
                 in the stacks or that are tagged using the same tag key . You
                 can  specify  up  to  500  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation
                 stacks.

                 CloudFormation -> (structure)
                     An array of the names of Amazon Web Services  CloudForma-

                     StackNames -> (list)
                        An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The  Amazon  Web Services tags that are used by resources
                     in the resource collection.

                     Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices  resources.  Many Amazon Web Services services sup-

                     from  different  services  to indicate that the resources
                     are related. For example, you can assign the same tag  to
                     an  Amazon  DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an
                     Lambda function. For more information about  using  tags,
                     see the Tagging best practices whitepaper.

                     Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                     o A  tag  key  (for  example,  CostCenter , Environment ,

                       the tag value is the same as  using  an  empty  string.
                       Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                     Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                     WARNING:
                        The string used for a key in a tag that you use to de-
                        fine your resource coverage must begin with the prefix
                        Devops-guru-  .  The  tag key might be DevOps-Guru-de-
                        ployment-application or devops-guru-rds-application  .
                        When  you create a key , the case of characters in the
                        key can be whatever you choose. After you create a key
                        , it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works
                        with a key named devops-guru-rds and a key  named  De-
                        vOps-Guru-RDS  , and these act as two different keys .
                        Possible key /value pairs in your application might be
                        Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS      or     De-
                        vops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                     (structure)
                        A collection of Amazon Web Services tags.

                        Tags help you identify and organize  your  Amazon  Web
                        Services  resources. Many Amazon Web Services services
                        support tagging, so you can assign the same tag to re-
                        sources  from  different services to indicate that the
                        resources are related. For example, you can assign the
                        same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you
                        assign to an Lambda  function.  For  more  information
                        about  using  tags,  see  the  Tagging  best practices
                        whitepaper.

                        Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                        o A tag key (for example, CostCenter ,  Environment  ,
                          Project , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                        o An optional field known as a tag value (for example,
                          111122223333 , Production , or a team  name).  Omit-
                          ting  the  tag  value  is the same as using an empty
                          string. Like tag keys , tag values  are  case-sensi-
                          tive.

                        Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                        WARNING:
                            The string used for a key in a tag that you use to
                            define your resource coverage must begin with  the
                            prefix  Devops-guru-  .  The  tag key might be De-
                            vOps-Guru-deployment-application      or       de-
                            vops-guru-rds-application  . When you create a key
                            , the case of characters in the key can  be  what-
                            ever  you  choose.  After you create a key , it is
                            case-sensitive. For  example,  DevOps  Guru  works
                            with  a  key named devops-guru-rds and a key named
                            DevOps-Guru-RDS , and these act as  two  different
                            keys  . Possible key /value pairs in your applica-
                            tion  might   be   Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                            tion/RDS     or    Devops-Guru-production-applica-
                            tion/containers .

                        AppBoundaryKey -> (string)
                            An Amazon Web Services tag key  that  is  used  to
                            identify  the  Amazon  Web Services resources that
                            DevOps Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web Services  re-
                            sources  in  your  account  and Region tagged with

                               The string used for a key in a tag that you use
                               to define your  resource  coverage  must  begin
                               with  the  prefix  Devops-guru-  .  The tag key
                               might be DevOps-Guru-deployment-application  or
                               devops-guru-rds-application . When you create a

                               key named DevOps-Guru-RDS , and  these  act  as
                               two  different keys . Possible key /value pairs
                               in your application might  be  Devops-Guru-pro-
                               duction-application/RDS  or Devops-Guru-produc-

                        TagValues -> (list)
                            The values in an Amazon Web Services  tag  collec-
                            tion.

                            The tag's value is an optional field used to asso-
                            ciate a string with  the  tag  key  (for  example,
                            111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). The
                            key and value are the tag's key pair. Omitting the
                            tag  value  is  the same as using an empty string.
                            Like tag keys , tag values are case-sensitive. You
                            can  specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag
                            value.
