OPTIONS
       --allow (structure)
          Features that are allowed while calculating. a route

          Hot -> (boolean)
              Allow Hot (High Occupancy  Toll)  lanes  while  calculating  the
              route.

          Hov -> (boolean)
              Allow  Hov  (High Occupancy vehicle) lanes while calculating the
              route.

          Hot=boolean,Hov=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Hot": true|false,
            "Hov": true|false
          }

       --arrival-time (string)

       --avoid (structure)
          Features that are avoided while calculating a route. Avoidance is on
          a best-case basis. If an avoidance can't be satisfied for a particu-
          lar case, it violates the avoidance and the returned  response  pro-
          duces a notice for the violation.

                     cluded while calculating the route.

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
