CALCULATE-ROUTE-MATRIX()                              CALCULATE-ROUTE-MATRIX()



NAME
       calculate-route-matrix -

DESCRIPTION
       Calculates route matrix containing the results for all pairs of Origins
       to Destinations. Each row corresponds to one entry in Origins. Each en-
       try  in  the row corresponds to the route from that entry in Origins to
       an entry in Destinations positions.

OPTIONS
       --allow (structure)
          Features that are allowed while calculating. a route

          Hot -> (boolean)
              Allow Hot (High Occupancy  Toll)  lanes  while  calculating  the
              route.

          Hov -> (boolean)
              Allow  Hov  (High Occupancy vehicle) lanes while calculating the
              route.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Hot=boolean,Hov=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {

          a best-case basis. If an avoidance can't be satisfied for a particu-
          lar case, it violates the avoidance and the returned  response  pro-
          duces a notice for the violation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
