NAME
       optimize-waypoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Calculates  the  optimal  order to travel between a set of waypoints to
       minimize either the travel time or the distance  travelled  during  the
       journey,  based  on  road  network restrictions and the traffic pattern
       data.

                        itude,) of the southwest corner of the  bounding  box;

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
