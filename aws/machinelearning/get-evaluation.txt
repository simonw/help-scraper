GET-EVALUATION()                                              GET-EVALUATION()



NAME
       get-evaluation -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  Evaluation  that  includes metadata as well as the current
       status of the Evaluation .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-evaluation
          --evaluation-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --evaluation-id (string)
          The ID of the Evaluation to retrieve. The evaluation of each MLModel
          is  recorded  and cataloged. The ID provides the means to access the
          information.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EvaluationId -> (string)
          The evaluation ID which is same as the EvaluationId in the request.

       MLModelId -> (string)
          The ID of the MLModel that was the focus of the evaluation.

       EvaluationDataSourceId -> (string)
          The DataSource used for this evaluation.

       InputDataLocationS3 -> (string)
          The  location of the data file or directory in Amazon Simple Storage
          Service (Amazon S3).

       CreatedByIamUser -> (string)
          The AWS user account that invoked the evaluation. The  account  type
          can be either an AWS root account or an AWS Identity and Access Man-
          agement (IAM) user account.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The time that the Evaluation was created. The time is  expressed  in
          epoch time.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The time of the most recent edit to the Evaluation . The time is ex-
          pressed in epoch time.

       Name -> (string)
          A user-supplied name or description of the Evaluation .

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the evaluation. This element can have one of the  fol-
          lowing values:

          o PENDING  - Amazon Machine Language (Amazon ML) submitted a request
            to evaluate an MLModel .

          o INPROGRESS - The evaluation is underway.

          o FAILED - The request to evaluate an MLModel did not run to comple-
            tion. It is not usable.

          o COMPLETED - The evaluation process completed successfully.

          o DELETED - The Evaluation is marked as deleted. It is not usable.

       PerformanceMetrics -> (structure)
          Measurements  of  how  well the MLModel performed using observations
          referenced by the DataSource . One of the following  metric  is  re-
          turned based on the type of the MLModel :

          o BinaryAUC:  A  binary  MLModel uses the Area Under the Curve (AUC)
            technique to measure performance.

          o RegressionRMSE: A regression MLModel uses the Root Mean Square Er-
            ror  (RMSE)  technique  to  measure performance. RMSE measures the
            difference between predicted and actual values for a single  vari-
            able.

          o MulticlassAvgFScore:  A multiclass MLModel uses the F1 score tech-
            nique to measure performance.

          For more information  about  performance  metrics,  please  see  the
          Amazon Machine Learning Developer Guide .

          Properties -> (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       LogUri -> (string)
          A link to the file that contains logs of the CreateEvaluation opera-
          tion.

       Message -> (string)
          A description of  the  most  recent  details  about  evaluating  the
          MLModel .

       ComputeTime -> (long)
          The  approximate CPU time in milliseconds that Amazon Machine Learn-
          ing spent processing the Evaluation , normalized and scaled on  com-
          putation  resources. ComputeTime is only available if the Evaluation
          is in the COMPLETED state.

       FinishedAt -> (timestamp)
          The epoch time when Amazon Machine Learning marked the Evaluation as
          COMPLETED  or FAILED . FinishedAt is only available when the Evalua-
          tion is in the COMPLETED or FAILED state.

       StartedAt -> (timestamp)
          The epoch time when Amazon Machine Learning marked the Evaluation as
          INPROGRESS  .  StartedAt isn't available if the Evaluation is in the
          PENDING state.
