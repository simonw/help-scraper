GET-DATA-SOURCE()                                            GET-DATA-SOURCE()



NAME
       get-data-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a DataSource that includes metadata and data file information,
       as well as the current status of the DataSource .
          GetDataSource provides results in normal or verbose format. The ver-
          bose  format  adds  the  schema  description  and  the list of files
          pointed to by the DataSource to the normal format.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-data-source
          --data-source-id <value>
          [--verbose | --no-verbose]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --data-source-id (string)
          The ID assigned to the DataSource at creation.

       --verbose | --no-verbose (boolean)
          Specifies whether the GetDataSource operation  should  return  Data-
          SourceSchema .

          If true, DataSourceSchema is returned.

          If false, DataSourceSchema is not returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
