GET-ML-MODEL()                                                  GET-ML-MODEL()



NAME
       get-ml-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an MLModel that includes detailed metadata, data source infor-
       mation, and the current status of the MLModel .
          GetMLModel provides results in normal or verbose format.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-ml-model
          --ml-model-id <value>
          [--verbose | --no-verbose]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ml-model-id (string)
          The ID assigned to the MLModel at creation.

       --verbose | --no-verbose (boolean)
          Specifies whether the GetMLModel operation should return Recipe .

          If true, Recipe is returned.

          If false, Recipe is not returned.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

          epoch time.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)

            to describe a MLModel .

          o INPROGRESS - The request is processing.

          o FAILED - The request did not run to completion. The ML model isn't
            usable.

          o COMPLETED - The request completed successfully.

          o DELETED - The MLModel is marked as deleted. It isn't usable.

              The maximum processing  rate  for  the  real-time  endpoint  for
              MLModel , measured in incoming requests per second.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that the request to create the real-time endpoint for
              the MLModel was received. The time is expressed in epoch time.

          EndpointUrl -> (string)
              The URI that specifies where to send  real-time  prediction  re-
              quests for the MLModel .
                 Note:  The application must wait until the real-time endpoint
                 is ready before using this URI.

          EndpointStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the real-time endpoint for the  MLModel  .
              This element can have one of the following values:

              o NONE - Endpoint does not exist or was previously deleted.

              o READY  -  Endpoint  is  ready to be used for real-time predic-
                tions.

              o UPDATING - Updating/creating the endpoint.

       TrainingParameters -> (map)
          A list of the training parameters in the MLModel . The list  is  im-
          plemented as a map of key-value pairs.

          The following is the current set of training parameters:

          o sgd.maxMLModelSizeInBytes - The maximum allowed size of the model.
            Depending on the input data, the size of the  model  might  affect
            its  performance.  The value is an integer that ranges from 100000
            to 2147483648 . The default value is 33554432 .

          o sgd.maxPasses - The number of times that the training process tra-
            verses the observations to build the MLModel . The value is an in-
            teger that ranges from 1 to 10000 . The default value is 10 .

          o sgd.shuffleType - Whether Amazon ML shuffles  the  training  data.
            Shuffling  data improves a model's ability to find the optimal so-
            lution for a variety of data types. The valid values are auto  and
            none  . The default value is none . We strongly recommend that you
            shuffle your data.

          o sgd.l1RegularizationAmount -  The  coefficient  regularization  L1
            norm. It controls overfitting the data by penalizing large coeffi-
            cients. This tends to drive coefficients to zero, resulting  in  a
            sparse feature set. If you use this parameter, start by specifying
            a small value, such as 1.0E-08 . The value is a double that ranges
            from 0 to MAX_DOUBLE . The default is to not use L1 normalization.
            This parameter can't be used when L2 is specified. Use this param-
            eter sparingly.

          o sgd.l2RegularizationAmount  -  The  coefficient  regularization L2
            norm. It controls overfitting the data by penalizing large coeffi-
            cients. This tends to drive coefficients to small, nonzero values.
            If you use this parameter, start by specifying a small value, such
            as  1.0E-08 . The value is a double that ranges from 0 to MAX_DOU-
            BLE . The default is to not use L2 normalization.  This  parameter
            can't be used when L1 is specified. Use this parameter sparingly.

          key -> (string)
              String type.

          value -> (string)
              String type.

       InputDataLocationS3 -> (string)
          The  location of the data file or directory in Amazon Simple Storage
          Service (Amazon S3).

       MLModelType -> (string)
          Identifies the MLModel category. The  following  are  the  available
          types:

          o REGRESSION  -- Produces a numeric result. For example, "What price
            should a house be listed at?"

          o BINARY -- Produces one of two possible results. For  example,  "Is
            this an e-commerce website?"

          o MULTICLASS  -- Produces one of several possible results. For exam-
            ple, "Is this a HIGH, LOW or MEDIUM risk trade?"

       ScoreThreshold -> (float)
          The scoring threshold is used in binary classification MLModel  mod-
          els. It marks the boundary between a positive prediction and a nega-
          tive prediction.

          Output values greater than or equal to the threshold receive a posi-
          tive result from the MLModel, such as true . Output values less than
          the threshold receive a negative response from the MLModel, such  as
          false .

       ScoreThresholdLastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The time of the most recent edit to the ScoreThreshold . The time is
          expressed in epoch time.

       LogUri -> (string)
          A link to the file that contains logs of  the  CreateMLModel  opera-
          tion.

       Message -> (string)

          .

       ComputeTime -> (long)
          The approximate CPU time in milliseconds that Amazon Machine  Learn-
          ing spent processing the MLModel , normalized and scaled on computa-
          tion resources. ComputeTime is only available if the MLModel  is  in
          the COMPLETED state.

       FinishedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  epoch  time  when Amazon Machine Learning marked the MLModel as
          COMPLETED or FAILED . FinishedAt is only available when the  MLModel
          is in the COMPLETED or FAILED state.

       StartedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  epoch  time  when Amazon Machine Learning marked the MLModel as
          INPROGRESS . StartedAt isn't available if  the  MLModel  is  in  the
          PENDING state.

       Recipe -> (string)
          The  recipe  to  use when training the MLModel . The Recipe provides
          detailed information about the observation data to use during train-
          ing,  and  manipulations  to  perform on the observation data during
          training.
              Note: This parameter is provided as part of the verbose format.

       Schema -> (string)
          The schema used by all of the data files  referenced  by  the  Data-
