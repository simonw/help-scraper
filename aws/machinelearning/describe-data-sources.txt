DESCRIBE-DATA-SOURCES()                                DESCRIBE-DATA-SOURCES()



NAME
       describe-data-sources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of DataSource that match the search criteria in the re-
       quest.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-data-sources is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Results

OPTIONS
       --filter-variable (string)
          Use one of the following variables to filter a list of DataSource :

          o CreatedAt - Sets the search criteria to DataSource creation dates.

          o Status - Sets the search criteria to DataSource statuses.

          o Name  -  Sets  the  search  criteria to the contents of DataSource
            Name .

          o DataUri - Sets the search criteria to the URI of data  files  used
            to  create  the DataSource . The URI can identify either a file or
            an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or directory.

          o IAMUser - Sets the search criteria to the user  account  that  in-
            voked the DataSource creation.

          Possible values:

          o CreatedAt

          o LastUpdatedAt

          o Status

          o Name

          o DataLocationS3

          o IAMUser

       --eq (string)
          The  equal to operator. The DataSource results will have FilterVari-
          able values that exactly match the value specified with EQ .

       --gt (string)
          The greater than operator. The DataSource results will have  Filter-
          Variable values that are greater than the value specified with GT .

       --lt (string)
          The less than operator. The DataSource results will have FilterVari-
          able values that are less than the value specified with LT .

       --ge (string)
          The greater than or equal to operator. The DataSource  results  will
          have  FilterVariable  values  that  are greater than or equal to the
          value specified with GE .

       --le (string)
          The less than or equal to operator. The DataSource results will have
          FilterVariable values that are less than or equal to the value spec-
          ified with LE .

       --ne (string)
          The not equal to operator. The DataSource results will have  Filter-
          Variable values not equal to the value specified with NE .

       --prefix (string)
          A  string that is found at the beginning of a variable, such as Name
          or Id .

          For example, a DataSource could have the  Name   2014-09-09-Holiday-
          GiftMailer  .  To  search  for this DataSource , select Name for the
          FilterVariable and any of the following strings for the Prefix :

          o 2014-09

          o 2014-09-09

          o 2014-09-09-Holiday

       --sort-order (string)
          A two-value parameter that determines the sequence of the  resulting
          list of DataSource .

          o asc - Arranges the list in ascending order (A-Z, 0-9).

          o dsc - Arranges the list in descending order (Z-A, 9-0).

          Results are sorted by FilterVariable .

          Possible values:

          o asc

          o dsc

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
