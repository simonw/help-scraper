NAME
       describe-ml-models -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  MLModel that match the search criteria in the re-
       quest.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-ml-models is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Results

       --ge (string)
          The greater than or equal to operator. The MLModel results will have
          FilterVariable values that are greater than or equal  to  the  value
          specified with GE .

          The  less  than  or equal to operator. The MLModel results will have
          FilterVariable values that are less than or equal to the value spec-
          ified with LE .

       --ne (string)
          The not equal to operator. The MLModel results will have FilterVari-
          able values not equal to the value specified with NE .

       --prefix (string)

          or Id .

          For example, an MLModel could have the Name  2014-09-09-HolidayGift-
          Mailer . To search for this MLModel , select Name  for  the  Filter-
          Variable and any of the following strings for the Prefix :

          o 2014-09

          o 2014-09-09

          o 2014-09-09-Holiday

       --sort-order (string)
          A  two-value parameter that determines the sequence of the resulting
          list of MLModel .

          o asc - Arranges the list in ascending order (A-Z, 0-9).

          o dsc - Arranges the list in descending order (Z-A, 9-0).

          Results are sorted by FilterVariable .

          Possible values:

          o asc

          o dsc

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     The URI that specifies where to send real-time prediction
                     requests for the MLModel .
                        Note: The application must wait  until  the  real-time
                        endpoint is ready before using this URI.

                     The  current  status  of  the  real-time endpoint for the
                     MLModel . This element can have one of the following val-
                     ues:

                     o NONE  -  Endpoint  does  not  exist  or  was previously

              TrainingParameters -> (map)
                 A  list  of the training parameters in the MLModel . The list
                 is implemented as a map of key-value pairs.

                 The following is the current set of training parameters:

                 o sgd.maxMLModelSizeInBytes - The maximum allowed size of the
                   model.  Depending  on the input data, the size of the model
                   might affect its performance. The value is an integer  that
                   ranges  from  100000  to  2147483648 . The default value is
                   33554432 .

                 o sgd.maxPasses - The  number  of  times  that  the  training
                   process  traverses  the observations to build the MLModel .
                   The value is an integer that ranges from 1 to 10000  .  The
                   default value is 10 .

                 o sgd.shuffleType  -  Whether Amazon ML shuffles the training
                   data. Shuffling the data improves a model's ability to find
                   the optimal solution for a variety of data types. The valid
                   values are auto and none . The default value is none .

                 o sgd.l1RegularizationAmount - The coefficient regularization
                   L1  norm, which controls overfitting the data by penalizing
                   large coefficients. This parameter tends to  drive  coeffi-
                   cients to zero, resulting in sparse feature set. If you use
                   this parameter, start by specifying a small value, such  as
                   1.0E-08  .  The  value  is  a  double that ranges from 0 to
                   MAX_DOUBLE . The default is to not  use  L1  normalization.
                   This parameter can't be used when L2 is specified. Use this
                   parameter sparingly.

                 o sgd.l2RegularizationAmount - The coefficient regularization
                   L2  norm, which controls overfitting the data by penalizing
                   large coefficients. This tends  to  drive  coefficients  to
                   small,  nonzero values. If you use this parameter, start by
                   specifying a small value, such as 1.0E-08 . The value is  a
                   double that ranges from 0 to MAX_DOUBLE . The default is to
                   not use L2 normalization. This parameter can't be used when
                   L1 is specified. Use this parameter sparingly.

                 key -> (string)
                     String type.

                 value -> (string)
                     String type.

              InputDataLocationS3 -> (string)
                 The  location  of the data file or directory in Amazon Simple
                 Storage Service (Amazon S3).

              Algorithm -> (string)
                 The algorithm used to train the MLModel . The following algo-
                 rithm is supported:

                 o SGD  --  Stochastic gradient descent. The goal of SGD is to
                   minimize the gradient of the loss function.

              MLModelType -> (string)
                 Identifies the MLModel category. The following are the avail-
                 able types:

                 o REGRESSION  - Produces a numeric result. For example, "What
                   price should a house be listed at?"

                 o BINARY - Produces one of two possible results. For example,
                   "Is this a child-friendly web site?".

                 o MULTICLASS  - Produces one of several possible results. For
                   example, "Is this a HIGH-, LOW-, or MEDIUM-risk trade?".

              ScoreThreshold -> (float)

              ScoreThresholdLastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time of the most recent edit to the ScoreThreshold .  The

                 MLModel .

              FinishedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp represented in epoch time.

              StartedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp represented in epoch time.

       NextToken -> (string)
