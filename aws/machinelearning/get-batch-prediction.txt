GET-BATCH-PREDICTION()                                  GET-BATCH-PREDICTION()



NAME
       get-batch-prediction -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a BatchPrediction that includes detailed metadata, status, and
       data file information for a Batch Prediction request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-batch-prediction
          --batch-prediction-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --batch-prediction-id (string)
          An ID assigned to the BatchPrediction at creation.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       BatchPredictionId -> (string)
          An ID assigned to the BatchPrediction at creation. This value should
          be identical to the value of the BatchPredictionID in the request.

       MLModelId -> (string)
          The ID of the MLModel that generated predictions for  the  BatchPre-
          diction request.

       BatchPredictionDataSourceId -> (string)
          The ID of the DataSource that was used to create the BatchPrediction
          .

       InputDataLocationS3 -> (string)
          The location of the data file or directory in Amazon Simple  Storage
          Service (Amazon S3).

       CreatedByIamUser -> (string)
          The  AWS user account that invoked the BatchPrediction . The account
          type can be either an AWS root account or an AWS Identity and Access
          Management (IAM) user account.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The time when the BatchPrediction was created. The time is expressed
          in epoch time.

       LastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The time of the most recent edit to BatchPrediction .  The  time  is
          expressed in epoch time.

       Name -> (string)
          A user-supplied name or description of the BatchPrediction .

       Status -> (string)
          The  status of the BatchPrediction , which can be one of the follow-
          ing values:

          o PENDING - Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) submitted a  request
            to generate batch predictions.

          o INPROGRESS - The batch predictions are in progress.

          o FAILED  - The request to perform a batch prediction did not run to
            completion. It is not usable.

          o COMPLETED - The batch prediction process completed successfully.

          o DELETED - The BatchPrediction is marked as deleted. It is not  us-
            able.

       OutputUri -> (string)
          The  location of an Amazon S3 bucket or directory to receive the op-
          eration results.

       LogUri -> (string)
          A link to the file that contains logs of  the  CreateBatchPrediction
          operation.

       Message -> (string)
          A  description of the most recent details about processing the batch
          prediction request.

       ComputeTime -> (long)
          The approximate CPU time in milliseconds that Amazon Machine  Learn-
          ing  spent processing the BatchPrediction , normalized and scaled on
          computation resources. ComputeTime is only available if  the  Batch-
          Prediction is in the COMPLETED state.

       FinishedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  epoch time when Amazon Machine Learning marked the BatchPredic-
          tion as COMPLETED or FAILED . FinishedAt is only available when  the
          BatchPrediction is in the COMPLETED or FAILED state.

       StartedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  epoch time when Amazon Machine Learning marked the BatchPredic-
          tion as INPROGRESS . StartedAt isn't available if  the  BatchPredic-
          tion is in the PENDING state.

       TotalRecordCount -> (long)
          The  number  of total records that Amazon Machine Learning saw while
          processing the BatchPrediction .

       InvalidRecordCount -> (long)
          The number of invalid records that Amazon Machine Learning saw while
          processing the BatchPrediction .
