NAME
       describe-batch-predictions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of BatchPrediction operations that match the search cri-
       teria in the request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-batch-predictions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Results

OPTIONS
       --filter-variable (string)
          Use  one of the following variables to filter a list of BatchPredic-
          tion :

          o CreatedAt - Sets the search criteria to the  BatchPrediction  cre-
            ation date.

          o Status - Sets the search criteria to the BatchPrediction status.

            diction
            **
            **  Name .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 72)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          o IAMUser - Sets the search criteria to the user  account  that  in-
            voked the BatchPrediction creation.

            the BatchPrediction .

          o DataURI - Sets the search criteria to the data file(s) used in the
            BatchPrediction . The URL can identify either a file or an  Amazon
            Simple Storage Solution (Amazon S3) bucket or directory.

          Possible values:

          o CreatedAt

          o LastUpdatedAt

          o Status

          o Name

          o DataSourceId

          o DataURI

       --eq (string)
          The equal to operator. The BatchPrediction results will have Filter-
          Variable values that exactly match the value specified with EQ .

       --gt (string)
          The greater than operator. The  BatchPrediction  results  will  have
          FilterVariable values that are greater than the value specified with
          GT .

       --lt (string)
          The less than operator. The BatchPrediction results will  have  Fil-
          terVariable values that are less than the value specified with LT .

       --ge (string)
          The  greater  than or equal to operator. The BatchPrediction results
          will have FilterVariable values that are greater than  or  equal  to
          the value specified with GE .

       --le (string)
          The less than or equal to operator. The BatchPrediction results will
          have FilterVariable values that are less than or equal to the  value
          specified with LE .

       --ne (string)
          The  not  equal  to  operator. The BatchPrediction results will have
          FilterVariable values not equal to the value specified with NE .

       --prefix (string)
          A string that is found at the beginning of a variable, such as  Name
          or Id .

          For  example,  a  Batch  Prediction  operation  could  have the Name
          2014-09-09-HolidayGiftMailer . To search for this BatchPrediction  ,
          select  Name for the FilterVariable and any of the following strings
          for the Prefix :

          o 2014-09

          o 2014-09-09

          o 2014-09-09-Holiday

       --sort-order (string)
          A two-value parameter that determines the sequence of the  resulting
          list of MLModel s.

          o asc - Arranges the list in ascending order (A-Z, 0-9).

          o dsc - Arranges the list in descending order (Z-A, 9-0).

          Results are sorted by FilterVariable .

          Possible values:

          o asc

          o dsc

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
