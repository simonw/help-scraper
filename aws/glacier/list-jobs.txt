LIST-JOBS()                                                        LIST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  lists  jobs  for  a  vault,  including  jobs  that are
       in-progress and jobs that have recently finished. The List  Job  opera-
       tion returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation time.

       NOTE:
          Amazon  Glacier  retains recently completed jobs for a period before
          deleting them; however, it eventually removes  completed  jobs.  The
          output  of completed jobs can be retrieved. Retaining completed jobs
          for a period of time after they have completed enables you to get  a
          job  output in the event you miss the job completion notification or
          your first attempt to download it fails. For  example,  suppose  you
          start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job
          completes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network
          error.  In  this  scenario,  you  can retry and download the archive
          while the job exists.

       The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You  should  always  check
       the  response  Marker  field.  If  there  are no more jobs to list, the
       Marker field is set to null . If there  are  more  jobs  to  list,  the
       Marker  field is set to a non-null value, which you can use to continue
       the pagination of the list. To return a list of jobs that begins  at  a
       specific  job, set the marker request parameter to the Marker value for
       that job that you obtained from a previous List Jobs request.

       You can set a maximum limit for the number of jobs returned in the  re-
       sponse  by  specifying  the limit parameter in the request. The default
       limit is 50. The number of jobs returned might be fewer than the limit,
       but the number of returned jobs never exceeds the limit.

       Additionally,  you  can filter the jobs list returned by specifying the
       optional statuscode parameter or completed parameter,  or  both.  Using
       the  statuscode  parameter,  you  can  specify to return only jobs that
       match either the InProgress , Succeeded , or Failed status.  Using  the
       completed parameter, you can specify to return only jobs that were com-
       pleted (true ) or jobs that were not completed (false ).

       For more information about using this operation, see the  documentation
       for the underlying REST API List Jobs .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: JobList

SYNOPSIS
            list-jobs
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          [--statuscode <value>]
          [--completed <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account  that  owns
          the  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
          single '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses  the  AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens  ('-')  in  the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --statuscode (string)
          The type of job status to return. You can specify the following val-
          ues: InProgress , Succeeded , or Failed .

       --completed (string)
          The state of the jobs to return. You can specify true or false .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Amazon  Glacier  requires an account ID argument when performing opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

OUTPUT
       JobList -> (list)
          A list of job objects. Each job object contains metadata  describing
          the job.

                 toryRetrieval , or Select .

              ArchiveId -> (string)
                 The archive ID requested for a  select  job  or  archive  re-
                 trieval. Otherwise, this field is null.

              VaultARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault from which an ar-
                 chive retrieval was requested.

              CreationDate -> (string)
                 The UTC date when the job was created. This value is a string
                 representation   of   ISO   8601  date  format,  for  example
                 "2012-03-20T17:03:43.221Z" .

              Completed -> (boolean)
                 The job status. When a job is completed, you  get  the  job's
                 output using Get Job Output (GET output).

              StatusCode -> (string)
                 The  status  code can be InProgress , Succeeded , or Failed ,
                 and indicates the status of the job.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A friendly message that describes the job status.

              ArchiveSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 For an archive retrieval job, this value is the size in bytes
                 of the archive being requested for download. For an inventory
                 retrieval or select job, this value is null.

              InventorySizeInBytes -> (long)
                 For an inventory retrieval job, this value  is  the  size  in
                 bytes of the inventory requested for download. For an archive
                 retrieval or select job, this value is null.

              SNSTopic -> (string)
                 An Amazon SNS topic that receives notification.

              CompletionDate -> (string)

                 in progress, the value is null.

              SHA256TreeHash -> (string)
                 For  an  archive retrieval job, this value is the checksum of
                 the archive. Otherwise, this value is null.

                 The SHA256 tree hash value for the requested range of an  ar-
                 chive.  If the InitiateJob request for an archive specified a
                 tree-hash aligned range, then this field returns a value.

                 If the whole archive is retrieved, this value is the same  as
                 the ArchiveSHA256TreeHash value.

                 This field is null for the following:

                 o Archive  retrieval  jobs  that  specify a range that is not
                   tree-hash aligned

                 o Archival jobs that specify a range that  is  equal  to  the
                   whole archive, when the job status is InProgress

                 o Inventory jobs

                 o Select jobs

              ArchiveSHA256TreeHash -> (string)
                 The SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive for an archive re-
                 trieval. For inventory retrieval or select jobs,  this  field
                 is null.

              RetrievalByteRange -> (string)
                 The  retrieved  byte  range for archive retrieval jobs in the
                 form StartByteValue -EndByteValue . If no range was specified
                 in  the  archive  retrieval,  then  the  whole archive is re-
                 trieved. In this case, StartByteValue equals 0  and  EndByte-
                 Value  equals  the size of the archive minus 1. For inventory
                 retrieval or select jobs, this field is null.

              Tier -> (string)
                 The tier to use for a select or an archive  retrieval.  Valid
                 values  are  Expedited , Standard , or Bulk . Standard is the
                 default.

              InventoryRetrievalParameters -> (structure)
                 Parameters used for range inventory retrieval.

                 Format -> (string)
                     The output format for the vault inventory list, which  is
                     set  by  the InitiateJob request when initiating a job to
                     retrieve a vault inventory. Valid values are CSV and JSON
                     .

                 StartDate -> (string)
                     The start of the date range in Universal Coordinated Time
                     (UTC) for vault inventory  retrieval  that  includes  ar-
                     chives  created  on or after this date. This value should
                     be a string in the ISO  8601  date  format,  for  example
                     2013-03-20T17:03:43Z .

                 EndDate -> (string)
                     The  end of the date range in UTC for vault inventory re-
                     trieval that includes archives created before this  date.
                     This  value  should be a string in the ISO 8601 date for-
                     mat, for example 2013-03-20T17:03:43Z .

                 Limit -> (string)
                     The maximum number of inventory items returned per  vault
                     inventory  retrieval request. This limit is set when ini-
                     tiating the job with the a InitiateJob request.

                 Marker -> (string)
                     An opaque string that represents where to continue  pagi-
                     nation  of the vault inventory retrieval results. You use
                     the marker in a new InitiateJob request to  obtain  addi-
                     tional  inventory  items.  If there are no more inventory
                     items, this value is null .  For  more  information,  see
