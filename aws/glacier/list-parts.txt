LIST-PARTS()                                                      LIST-PARTS()



NAME
       list-parts -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation lists the parts of an archive that have been uploaded in
       a specific multipart upload. You can make this request at any time dur-
       ing an in-progress multipart upload before you complete the upload (see
       CompleteMultipartUpload . List Parts returns an error for completed up-
       loads.  The  list returned in the List Parts response is sorted by part
       range.

       The List Parts operation supports pagination. By default,  this  opera-
       tion returns up to 50 uploaded parts in the response. You should always
       check the response for a marker at which to continue the list; if there
       are  no  more items the marker is null . To return a list of parts that
       begins at a specific part, set the  marker  request  parameter  to  the
       value  you  obtained  from  a previous List Parts request. You can also
       limit the number of parts returned in the response  by  specifying  the
       limit parameter in the request.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For  conceptual  information  and  the underlying REST API, see Working
       with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier and List Parts in the Amazon Glacier
       Developer Guide .

       list-parts  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Parts

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account  that  owns
          the  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
          single '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses  the  AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens  ('-')  in  the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --upload-id (string)
          The upload ID of the multipart upload.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The  following  command lists the uploaded parts for a multipart upload
       to a vault named my-vault:

          aws glacier list-parts --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --upload-id "SYZi7qnL-YGqGwAm8Kn3BLP2ElNCvnB-5961R09CSaPmPwkYGHOqeN_nX3-Vhnd2yF0KfB5FkmbnBU9GubbdrCs8ut-D"

          }

       Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when  performing  opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

       AWS CLI, see Using Amazon Glacier in the AWS CLI User Guide.

          The ID of the upload to which the parts are associated.

       VaultARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault to which  the  multipart
          upload was initiated.

       ArchiveDescription -> (string)
          The  description  of  the archive that was specified in the Initiate
          Multipart Upload request.

       PartSizeInBytes -> (long)

          the Initiate Multipart Upload request.

       CreationDate -> (string)
          The UTC time at which the multipart upload was initiated.

       Parts -> (list)
          A list of the part sizes of the multipart upload. Each object in the
          array contains a RangeBytes and sha256-tree-hash name/value pair.

          (structure)
              A list of the part sizes of the multipart upload.

              RangeInBytes -> (string)
                 The byte range of a part, inclusive of the upper value of the
                 range.

              SHA256TreeHash -> (string)
                 The  SHA256 tree hash value that Amazon S3 Glacier calculated

          null .
