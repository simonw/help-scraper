NAME
       initiate-job -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  initiates  a job of the specified type, which can be a
       select, an archival retrieval, or a vault retrieval. For more  informa-
       tion about using this operation, see the documentation for the underly-
       ing REST API Initiate a Job .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            initiate-job
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          [--job-parameters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account  that  owns
          the  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
          single '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses  the  AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens  ('-')  in  the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --job-parameters (structure)
          Provides options for specifying job information.

          Format -> (string)
              When initiating a job to retrieve a vault inventory, you can op-
              tionally add this parameter to your request to specify the  out-
              put  format.  If  you are initiating an inventory job and do not
              specify a Format field, JSON is the default format. Valid values
              are "CSV" and "JSON".

          Type -> (string)
              The  job  type. You can initiate a job to perform a select query
              on an archive, retrieve an archive, or get  an  inventory  of  a
              vault.  Valid  values are "select", "archive-retrieval" and "in-
              ventory-retrieval".

          ArchiveId -> (string)
              The ID of the archive that you want to retrieve. This  field  is
              required  only  if  Type  is  set to select or archive-retrieval
              code>. An error occurs if you specify this request parameter for
              an inventory retrieval job request.

          Description -> (string)
              The  optional  description  for the job. The description must be
              less than or equal to 1,024 bytes. The allowable characters  are
              7-bit  ASCII  without  control  codes-specifically, ASCII values
              32-126 decimal or 0x20-0x7E hexadecimal.

          SNSTopic -> (string)
              The Amazon SNS topic ARN to which Amazon S3 Glacier sends a  no-
              tification when the job is completed and the output is ready for
              you to download. The specified topic publishes the  notification
              to its subscribers. The SNS topic must exist.

          RetrievalByteRange -> (string)
              The byte range to retrieve for an archive retrieval. in the form
              "StartByteValue -EndByteValue " If not specified, the whole  ar-
              chive  is  retrieved.  If  specified,  the  byte  range  must be
              megabyte (1024*1024) aligned  which  means  that  StartByteValue
              must be divisible by 1 MB and EndByteValue plus 1 must be divis-
              ible by 1 MB or be the end of the archive specified as  the  ar-
              chive  byte  size  value  minus  1. If RetrievalByteRange is not
              megabyte aligned, this operation returns a 400 response.

              An error occurs if you specify this field for an  inventory  re-
              trieval job request.

          Tier -> (string)
              The  tier to use for a select or an archive retrieval job. Valid
              values are Expedited , Standard , or Bulk . Standard is the  de-
              fault.

                 The  start  of  the date range in UTC for vault inventory re-
                 trieval that includes archives created on or after this date.
                 This  value  should  be a string in the ISO 8601 date format,
                 for example 2013-03-20T17:03:43Z .

              EndDate -> (string)
                 The end of the date range in  UTC  for  vault  inventory  re-
                 trieval that includes archives created before this date. This
                 value should be a string in the ISO 8601 date format, for ex-
                 ample 2013-03-20T17:03:43Z .

              Limit -> (string)
                 Specifies  the maximum number of inventory items returned per

                 than or equal to 1.

              Marker -> (string)
                 An opaque string that represents where to continue pagination

                 in  a  new InitiateJob request to obtain additional inventory
                 items. If there are no more inventory items,  this  value  is

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command initiates a job to get an inventory of the  vault
       my-vault:

          aws glacier initiate-job --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --job-parameters '{"Type": "inventory-retrieval"}'

       Output:

          {
              "location": "/0123456789012/vaults/my-vault/jobs/zbxcm3Z_3z5UkoroF7SuZKrxgGoDc3RloGduS7Eg-RO47Yc6FxsdGBgf_Q2DK5Ejh18CnTS5XW4_XqlNHS61dsO4CnMW",
              "jobId": "zbxcm3Z_3z5UkoroF7SuZKrxgGoDc3RloGduS7Eg-RO47Yc6FxsdGBgf_Q2DK5Ejh18CnTS5XW4_XqlNHS61dsO4CnMW"
          }

       Amazon  Glacier  requires an account ID argument when performing opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

       The following command initiates a job to retrieve an archive  from  the
       vault my-vault:

          aws glacier initiate-job --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --job-parameters file://job-archive-retrieval.json

       job-archive-retrieval.json  is  a  JSON  file  in the local folder that
       specifies the type of job, archive ID, and some optional parameters:

          {
