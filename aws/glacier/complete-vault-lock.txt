COMPLETE-VAULT-LOCK()                                    COMPLETE-VAULT-LOCK()



NAME
       complete-vault-lock -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the
       vault lock from the InProgress state to the Locked state, which  causes
       the  vault lock policy to become unchangeable. A vault lock is put into
       the InProgress state by calling  InitiateVaultLock . You can obtain the
       state of the vault lock by calling  GetVaultLock . For more information
       about the vault locking process, Amazon Glacier Vault Lock .

       This operation is idempotent. This request is always successful if  the
       vault  lock is in the Locked state and the provided lock ID matches the
       lock ID originally used to lock the vault.

       If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault  lock  is
       in the Locked state, the operation returns an AccessDeniedException er-
       ror. If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock
       is  in  the  InProgress state, the operation throws an InvalidParameter
       error.

SYNOPSIS
            complete-vault-lock
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          --lock-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
          AWS  account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the re-
          quest. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a sin-
          gle '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account
          ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If  you
          specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --lock-id (string)
          The  lockId  value is the lock ID obtained from a  InitiateVaultLock
          request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To complete an in-progress vault lock process

       The  following  complete-vault-lock  example  completes the in-progress
       locking progress for the specified vault and sets the lock state of the
       vault  lock to Locked. You get the value for the lock-id parameter when
       you run initiate-lock-process.

          aws glacier complete-vault-lock \
              --account-id - \
              --vault-name MyVaultName \
              --lock-id 9QZgEXAMPLEPhvL6xEXAMPLE

       This command produces no output.

       zon Glacier API Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
