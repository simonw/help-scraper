GET-JOB-OUTPUT()                                              GET-JOB-OUTPUT()



NAME
       get-job-output -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  downloads  the  output  of the job you initiated using
       InitiateJob . Depending on the job type you specified when  you  initi-
       ated  the job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a
       vault inventory.

       You can download all the job output or download a portion of the output
       by  specifying  a  byte range. In the case of an archive retrieval job,
       depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon  S3  Glacier  (Glacier)
       returns  the  checksum for the portion of the data. You can compute the
       checksum on the client and verify that the values match to  ensure  the
       portion you downloaded is the correct data.

       A  job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes
       the job. That a byte range. For both archive  and  inventory  retrieval
       jobs,  you  should verify the downloaded size against the size returned
       in the headers from the Get Job Output response.

       For archive retrieval jobs, you should also verify  that  the  size  is
       what  you  expected.  If  you download a portion of the output, the ex-
       pected size is based on the range of bytes you specified. For  example,
       if  you  specify  a  range  of bytes=0-1048575 , you should verify your
       download size is 1,048,576 bytes. If you download  an  entire  archive,
       the  expected  size  is the size of the archive when you uploaded it to
       Amazon S3 Glacier The expected size is also  returned  in  the  headers
       from the Get Job Output response.

       In  the  case  of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range
       you specify, Glacier returns the checksum for the portion of the  data.
       To  ensure  the portion you downloaded is the correct data, compute the
       checksum on the client, verify that the values match, and  verify  that
       the size is what you expected.

       A  job ID does not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier completes
       the job. That is, you can download the job output within the  24  hours
       period after Amazon Glacier completes the job.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

SYNOPSIS
            get-job-output
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--range <value>]
          <outfile>

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account  that  owns
          the  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
          single '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses  the  AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens  ('-')  in  the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --job-id (string)
          The job ID whose data is downloaded.

       --range (string)
          The  range of bytes to retrieve from the output. For example, if you
          want to download the first 1,048,576 bytes,  specify  the  range  as
          bytes=0-1048575  .  By  default, this operation downloads the entire
          output.

          If the job output is large, then you can use a range to  retrieve  a
          portion of the output. This allows you to download the entire output
          in smaller chunks of bytes. For example, suppose you have  1  GB  of
          job  output  you  want to download and you decide to download 128 MB
          chunks of data at a time, which is a total of eight Get  Job  Output
          requests. You use the following process to download the job output:

          o Download  a  128  MB chunk of output by specifying the appropriate
            byte range. Verify that all 128 MB of data was received.

          o Along with the data, the response includes a SHA256 tree  hash  of
            the payload. You compute the checksum of the payload on the client
            and compare it with the checksum you received in the  response  to
            ensure you received all the expected data.

          o Repeat  steps  1  and  2 for all the eight 128 MB chunks of output
            data, each time specifying the appropriate byte range.

          o After downloading all the parts of the job output, you have a list
            of eight checksum values. Compute the tree hash of these values to
            find the checksum of the entire  output.  Using  the   DescribeJob
            API,  obtain job information of the job that provided you the out-
            put. The response includes the  checksum  of  the  entire  archive
            stored  in  Amazon  S3  Glacier.  You  compare this value with the
            checksum you computed to ensure you have downloaded the entire ar-
            chive content with no errors.

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following command saves the output from a vault inventory job to a
       file in the current directory named output.json:

          aws glacier get-job-output --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --job-id zbxcm3Z_3z5UkoroF7SuZKrxgGoDc3RloGduS7Eg-RO47Yc6FxsdGBgf_Q2DK5Ejh18CnTS5XW4_XqlNHS61dsO4CnMW output.json

       The job-id is available in the output of aws  glacier  list-jobs.  Note
       that the output file name is a positional argument that is not prefixed
       by an option name. Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument  when
       performing  operations,  but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use
       account.

       Output:

          {
              "status": 200,
              "acceptRanges": "bytes",
              "contentType": "application/json"
          }

       output.json:

          {"VaultARN":"arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:0123456789012:vaults/my-vault","InventoryDate":"2015-04-07T00:26:18Z","ArchiveList":[{"ArchiveId":"kKB7ymWJVpPSwhGP6ycSOAekp9ZYe_--zM_mw6k76ZFGEIWQX-ybtRDvc2VkPSDtfKmQrj0IRQLSGsNuDp-AJVlu2ccmDSyDUmZwKbwbpAdGATGDiB3hHO0bjbGehXTcApVud_wyDw","ArchiveDescription":"multipart upload test","CreationDate":"2015-04-06T22:24:34Z","Size":3145728,"SHA256TreeHash":"9628195fcdbcbbe76cdde932d4646fa7de5f219fb39823836d81f0cc0e18aa67"}]}

OUTPUT
       body -> (blob)
          The job data, either archive data or inventory data.

       checksum -> (string)
          The checksum of the data in the response. This  header  is  returned
          only  when  retrieving the output for an archive retrieval job. Fur-
          thermore, this header appears only under the following conditions:

          o You get the entire range of the archive.

          o You request a range to return of the archive that starts and  ends
            on  a multiple of 1 MB. For example, if you have an 3.1 MB archive
            and you specify a range to return that starts at 1 MB and ends  at
            2  MB,  then  the x-amz-sha256-tree-hash is returned as a response
            header.

          o You request a range of the archive to return that starts on a mul-
            tiple  of 1 MB and goes to the end of the archive. For example, if
            you have a 3.1 MB archive and you specify a range that starts at 2
            MB  and  ends  at  3.1  MB  (the  end  of  the  archive), then the
            x-amz-sha256-tree-hash is returned as a response header.

       status -> (integer)
          The HTTP response code for a job output request. The  value  depends
          on whether a range was specified in the request.

       contentRange -> (string)
          The  range  of  bytes returned by Amazon S3 Glacier. If only partial
          output is downloaded, the response provides the range of bytes  Ama-
          zon  S3  Glacier  returned. For example, bytes 0-1048575/8388608 re-
          turns the first 1 MB from 8 MB.

       acceptRanges -> (string)
          Indicates the  range  units  accepted.  For  more  information,  see
          RFC2616 .

       contentType -> (string)
          The  Content-Type depends on whether the job output is an archive or
          a vault inventory. For archive data, the  Content-Type  is  applica-
          tion/octet-stream.  For vault inventory, if you requested CSV format
          when you initiated the job, the Content-Type is text/csv. Otherwise,
          by  default,  vault  inventory  is  returned  as  JSON, and the Con-
          tent-Type is application/json.

       archiveDescription -> (string)
          The description of an archive.
