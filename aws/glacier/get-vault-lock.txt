GET-VAULT-LOCK()                                              GET-VAULT-LOCK()



NAME
       get-vault-lock -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation retrieves the following attributes from the lock-policy
       subresource set on the specified vault:

       o The vault lock policy set on the vault.

       o The state of the vault lock, which is either InProgess or Locked .

       o When the lock ID expires. The lock ID is used to complete  the  vault
         locking process.

       o When the vault lock was initiated and put into the InProgress state.

       A  vault  lock  is  put into the InProgress state by calling  Initiate-
       VaultLock . A vault lock is put into the Locked state by calling   Com-
       pleteVaultLock  .  You  can  abort the vault locking process by calling
       AbortVaultLock . For more information about the vault locking  process,
       Amazon Glacier Vault Lock .

       If  there  is  no vault lock policy set on the vault, the operation re-
       turns a 404 Not found error. For  more  information  about  vault  lock
       policies, Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies .

SYNOPSIS
            get-vault-lock
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  AccountId  value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns
          the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally  a
          single  '-  ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If  you  use  an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the details of a vault lock

       The following get-vault-lock example retrieved the  details  about  the
       lock for the specified vault.

          aws glacier get-vault-lock \
              --account-id - \
              --vault-name MyVaultName

       Output:

          {
              "Policy": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"Define-vault-lock\",\"Effect\":\"Deny\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::999999999999:root\"},\"Action\":\"glacier:DeleteArchive\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:99999999999:vaults/MyVaultName\",\"Condition\":{\"NumericLessThanEquals\":{\"glacier:ArchiveAgeinDays\":\"365\"}}}]}",
              "State": "Locked",
              "CreationDate": "2019-07-29T22:25:28.640Z"
          }
