INITIATE-VAULT-LOCK()                                    INITIATE-VAULT-LOCK()



NAME
       initiate-vault-lock -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation initiates the vault locking process by doing the follow-
       ing:

       o Installing a vault lock policy on the specified vault.

       o Setting the lock state of vault lock to InProgress .

       o Returning a lock ID, which is used  to  complete  the  vault  locking
         process.

       You can set one vault lock policy for each vault and this policy can be
       up to 20 KB in size. For more information about  vault  lock  policies,
       see Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies .

       You  must  complete the vault locking process within 24 hours after the
       vault lock enters the InProgress state. After the 24 hour window  ends,
       the  lock  ID  expires,  the  vault  automatically exits the InProgress
       state, and the vault lock policy is removed from the  vault.  You  call
       CompleteVaultLock  to complete the vault locking process by setting the
       state of the vault lock to Locked .

       After a vault lock is in the Locked state, you cannot  initiate  a  new
       vault lock for the vault.

       You  can  abort  the vault locking process by calling  AbortVaultLock .
       You can get the state of the vault lock by calling  GetVaultLock .  For
       more  information about the vault locking process, Amazon Glacier Vault
       Lock .

       If this operation is called when the vault lock is  in  the  InProgress
       state,  the  operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. When the
       vault lock is in the InProgress state you must call  AbortVaultLock be-
       fore you can initiate a new vault lock policy.

SYNOPSIS
            initiate-vault-lock
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          [--policy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
          AWS account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the  re-
          quest. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a sin-
          gle '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account
          ID  associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If you
          specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --policy (structure)
          The vault lock policy as a JSON string, which uses "" as  an  escape
          character.

          Policy -> (string)
              The vault lock policy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Policy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Policy": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To initiate the vault locking process

       The  following initiate-vault-lock example installs a vault lock policy
       on the specified vault and sets the lock state of the vault lock to In-
       Progress.  You must complete the process by calling complete-vault-lock
       within 24 hours to set the state of the vault lock to Locked.

          aws glacier initiate-vault-lock \
              --account-id - \
              --vault-name MyVaultName \
              --policy file://vault_lock_policy.json

       Contents of vault_lock_policy.json:

          {"Policy":"{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"Define-vault-lock\",\"Effect\":\"Deny\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::999999999999:root\"},\"Action\":\"glacier:DeleteArchive\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:999999999999:vaults/examplevault\",\"Condition\":{\"NumericLessThanEquals\":{\"glacier:ArchiveAgeinDays\":\"365\"}}}]}"}

       The output is the vault lock ID that you can use to complete the  vault
       lock process.

          {
              "lockId": "9QZgEXAMPLEPhvL6xEXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy) in the
       Amazon Glacier API Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       lockId -> (string)
          The lock ID, which is used to complete the vault locking process.
