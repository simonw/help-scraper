SET-DATA-RETRIEVAL-POLICY()                        SET-DATA-RETRIEVAL-POLICY()



NAME
       set-data-retrieval-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation sets and then enacts a data retrieval policy in the re-
       gion specified in the PUT request. You can set one  policy  per  region
       for  an  AWS  account.  The policy is enacted within a few minutes of a
       successful PUT operation.

       The set policy operation does not affect retrieval jobs  that  were  in
       progress before the policy was enacted. For more information about data
       retrieval policies, see Amazon Glacier Data Retrieval Policies .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            set-data-retrieval-policy
          --account-id <value>
          [--policy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
          AWS  account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the re-
          quest. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a sin-
          gle '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account
          ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If  you
          specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

       --policy (structure)
          The data retrieval policy in JSON format.

          Rules -> (list)
              The  policy  rule. Although this is a list type, currently there
              must be only one rule, which contains a Strategy field  and  op-
              tionally a BytesPerHour field.

              (structure)
                 Data retrieval policy rule.

                 Strategy -> (string)
                     The type of data retrieval policy to set.

                     Valid values: BytesPerHour|FreeTier|None

                 BytesPerHour -> (long)
                     The  maximum  number of bytes that can be retrieved in an
                     hour.

                     This field is required only if the value of the  Strategy
                     field  is  BytesPerHour  . Your PUT operation will be re-
                     jected if the Strategy field is not set  to  BytesPerHour
                     and you set this field.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Rules=[{Strategy=string,BytesPerHour=long},{Strategy=string,BytesPerHour=long}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Rules": [
              {
                "Strategy": "string",
                "BytesPerHour": long
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The following command configures a data retrieval policy for the in-use
       account:

          aws glacier set-data-retrieval-policy --account-id - --policy file://data-retrieval-policy.json

       data-retrieval-policy.json  is  a  JSON file in the current folder that
       specifies a data retrieval policy:

          {
            "Rules":[
               {
                   "Strategy":"BytesPerHour",
                   "BytesPerHour":10737418240
                }
             ]
          }

       Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when  performing  opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

       The  following command sets the data retrieval policy to FreeTier using
       inline JSON:

          aws glacier set-data-retrieval-policy --account-id - --policy '{"Rules":[{"Strategy":"FreeTier"}]}'

       See Set Data Retrieval Policy in the Amazon Glacier API  Reference  for
       details on the policy format.

OUTPUT
       None
