LIST-MULTIPART-UPLOADS()                              LIST-MULTIPART-UPLOADS()



NAME
       list-multipart-uploads -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  lists  in-progress multipart uploads for the specified
       vault. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload  that  has
       been  initiated by an  InitiateMultipartUpload request, but has not yet
       been completed or aborted. The list returned in the List Multipart  Up-
       load response has no guaranteed order.

       The  List  Multipart Uploads operation supports pagination. By default,
       this operation returns up to 50 multipart uploads in the response.  You
       should  always check the response for a marker at which to continue the
       list; if there are no more items the marker is null . To return a  list
       of  multipart  uploads that begins at a specific upload, set the marker
       request parameter to the value you obtained from a previous List Multi-
       part  Upload request. You can also limit the number of uploads returned
       in the response by specifying the limit parameter in the request.

       Note the difference between this operation and listing  parts  (  List-
       Parts  ).  The List Multipart Uploads operation lists all multipart up-
       loads for a vault and does not require a multipart upload ID. The  List
       Parts  operation requires a multipart upload ID since parts are associ-
       ated with a single upload.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However,  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form  specific  actions. For more information, see Access Control Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For conceptual information and the underlying  REST  API,  see  Working
       with  Archives  in  Amazon S3 Glacier and List Multipart Uploads in the
       Amazon Glacier Developer Guide .

       list-multipart-uploads is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: UploadsList

SYNOPSIS
            list-multipart-uploads
          --account-id <value>
          --vault-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  AccountId  value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns
          the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally  a
          single  '-  ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If  you  use  an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  command  shows all of the in-progress multipart uploads
       for a vault named my-vault:

          aws glacier list-multipart-uploads --account-id - --vault-name my-vault

       Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when  performing  opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

       For  more  information on multipart uploads to Amazon Glacier using the
       AWS CLI, see Using Amazon Glacier in the AWS CLI User Guide.

OUTPUT
       UploadsList -> (list)
          A list of in-progress multipart uploads.

          (structure)
              A list of in-progress multipart uploads for a vault.

              MultipartUploadId -> (string)
                 The ID of a multipart upload.

              VaultARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault that contains the
                 archive.

              ArchiveDescription -> (string)
                 The description of the archive that was specified in the Ini-
                 tiate Multipart Upload request.

              PartSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The part size, in bytes, specified in the Initiate  Multipart
                 Upload  request. This is the size of all the parts in the up-
                 load except the last part, which may  be  smaller  than  this
                 size.

              CreationDate -> (string)
                 The UTC time at which the multipart upload was initiated.

       Marker -> (string)
          An opaque string that represents where to continue pagination of the
          results. You use the marker in a new List Multipart Uploads  request
          to  obtain  more  uploads in the list. If there are no more uploads,
          this value is null .
