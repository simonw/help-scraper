NAME
       get-sampling-statistic-summaries -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  recent sampling results for all sampling
       rules.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-sampling-statistic-summaries is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: SamplingStatisticSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            get-sampling-statistic-summaries
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SamplingStatisticSummaries -> (list)
          Information about the number of requests instrumented for each  sam-
          pling rule.

          (structure)
              Aggregated  request sampling data for a sampling rule across all
              services for a 10-second window.

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the sampling rule.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The start time of the reporting window.

              RequestCount -> (integer)
                 The number of requests that matched the rule.

              BorrowCount -> (integer)
                 The number  of  requests  recorded  with  borrowed  reservoir
                 quota.

              SampledCount -> (integer)
                 The number of requests recorded.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Pagination token.
