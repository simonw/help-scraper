       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-group
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--group-arn <value>]
          [--filter-expression <value>]
          [--insights-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The case-sensitive name of the group.

       --group-arn (string)
          The ARN that was generated upon creation.

       --filter-expression (string)
          The  updated  filter  expression defining criteria by which to group
          traces.

       --insights-configuration (structure)
          The structure containing configurations related to insights.

          o The InsightsEnabled boolean can be set to true to enable  insights
            for the group or false to disable insights for the group.

          o The  NotifcationsEnabled  boolean can be set to true to enable in-
            sights notifications for the group. Notifications can only be  en-
            abled on a group with InsightsEnabled set to true.

          InsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Set  the  InsightsEnabled  value  to  true to enable insights or
              false to disable insights.

          NotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Set the NotificationsEnabled value to true  to  enable  insights
              notifications. Notifications can only be enabled on a group with
              InsightsEnabled set to true.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InsightsEnabled=boolean,NotificationsEnabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InsightsEnabled": true|false,
            "NotificationsEnabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a group

       The following update-group example updates the criteria by which to ac-
       cept  traces  into  the group named AdminGroup. You can specify the de-
       sired group by using either the group name or group ARN.

          aws xray update-group \
              --group-name "AdminGroup" \
              --group-arn "arn:aws:xray:us-west-2:123456789012:group/AdminGroup/123456789" \
              --filter-expression "service(\"mydomain.com\") {fault}"

       Output:

          {
              "GroupName": "AdminGroup",
              "GroupARN": "arn:aws:xray:us-east-2:123456789012:group/AdminGroup/123456789",
              "FilterExpression": "service(\"mydomain.com\") {fault}"
          }

       Settings with the AWS X-Ray API in the AWS X-Ray Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The  group that was updated. Contains the name of the group that was
          updated, the ARN of the group that was updated, the  updated  filter
          expression,  and  the  updated insight configuration assigned to the
          group.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The unique case-sensitive name of the group.

          GroupARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the group generated  based  on
              the GroupName.

          FilterExpression -> (string)
              The filter expression defining the parameters to include traces.

          InsightsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The structure containing configurations related to insights.

              o The  InsightsEnabled  boolean can be set to true to enable in-
                sights for the group or false  to  disable  insights  for  the
                group.

              o The  NotificationsEnabled boolean can be set to true to enable
                insights notifications  through  Amazon  EventBridge  for  the
                group.

              InsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  the  InsightsEnabled value to true to enable insights or
                 false to disable insights.

              NotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set the NotificationsEnabled value to true to enable insights
                 notifications.  Notifications  can only be enabled on a group
                 with InsightsEnabled set to true.
