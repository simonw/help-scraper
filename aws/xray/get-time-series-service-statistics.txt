NAME
       get-time-series-service-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Get  an  aggregation  of  service statistics defined by a specific time
       range.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-time-series-service-statistics is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: TimeSeriesServiceStatistics

SYNOPSIS
            get-time-series-service-statistics
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--group-arn <value>]
          [--entity-selector-expression <value>]
          [--period <value>]
          [--forecast-statistics | --no-forecast-statistics]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time frame for which to aggregate statistics.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time frame for which to aggregate statistics.

       --group-name (string)
          The  case-sensitive  name  of the group for which to pull statistics
          from.

       --group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the group for which to  pull  sta-
          tistics from.

       --entity-selector-expression (string)
          A  filter  expression  defining entities that will be aggregated for
          statistics. Supports ID, service, and edge functions. If no selector
          expression is specified, edge statistics are returned.

       --period (integer)
          Aggregation period in seconds.

       --forecast-statistics | --no-forecast-statistics (boolean)
          The forecasted high and low fault count values. Forecast enabled re-
          quests require the EntitySelectorExpression ID be provided.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
