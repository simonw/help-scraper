GET-TRACE-SUMMARIES()                                    GET-TRACE-SUMMARIES()



NAME
       get-trace-summaries -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified time
       frame using an optional filter. To get the full traces, pass the  trace
       IDs to BatchGetTraces .

       A  filter  expression can target traced requests that hit specific ser-
       vice nodes or edges, have errors, or come from a known user. For  exam-
       ple,  the  following filter expression targets traces that pass through
       api.example.com :
          service("api.example.com")

       This filter expression finds traces that have an annotation  named  ac-
       count with the value 12345 :
          annotation.account = "12345"

       For a full list of indexed fields and keywords that you can use in fil-
       ter expressions, see Use filter expressions in the Amazon Web  Services
       X-Ray Developer Guide .

       get-trace-summaries is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: TraceSummaries

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time frame for which to retrieve traces.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time frame for which to retrieve traces.

       --time-range-type (string)
          Query trace summaries by TraceId (trace start  time),  Event  (trace
          update time), or Service (trace segment end time).

          Possible values:

          o TraceId

          o Event

          o Service

       --sampling | --no-sampling (boolean)
          Set to true to get summaries for only a subset of available traces.

       --sampling-strategy (structure)
          A  parameter  to  indicate  whether to enable sampling on trace sum-
          maries. Input parameters are Name and Value.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of a sampling rule.

          Value -> (double)
              The value of a sampling rule.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=double

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "PartialScan"|"FixedRate",
            "Value": double
          }

       --filter-expression (string)
          Specify a filter expression to retrieve trace summaries for services
          or requests that meet certain requirements.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
