PUT-TRACE-SEGMENTS()                                      PUT-TRACE-SEGMENTS()



NAME
       put-trace-segments -

DESCRIPTION
       Uploads  segment  documents to Amazon Web Services X-Ray. The X-Ray SDK
       generates segment documents and sends them to the X-Ray  daemon,  which
       uploads them in batches. A segment document can be a completed segment,
       an in-progress segment, or an array of subsegments.

       Segments must include the following fields. For the full segment  docu-
       ment  schema,  see  Amazon  Web Services X-Ray Segment Documents in the
       Amazon Web Services X-Ray Developer Guide .
          Required segment document fields

       o name - The name of the service that handled the request.

       o id - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique  among  segments  in
         the same trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits.

       o trace_id - A unique identifier that connects all segments and subseg-
         ments originating from a single client request.

       o start_time - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in  floating
         point  seconds  in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds. For example,
         1480615200.010 or 1.480615200010E9 .

       o end_time - Time the segment or subsegment was  closed.  For  example,
         1480615200.090  or  1.480615200090E9  . Specify either an end_time or
         in_progress .

       o in_progress - Set to true instead of specifying an end_time to record
         that  a  segment  has  been  started,  but  is  not complete. Send an
         in-progress segment when your application  receives  a  request  that
         will  take  a  long  time to serve, to trace that the request was re-
         ceived. When the response is sent, send the complete segment to over-
         write the in-progress segment.

       A trace_id consists of three numbers separated by hyphens. For example,
       1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. This includes:
          Trace ID Format

       o The version number, for instance, 1 .

       o The time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8  hexadeci-
         mal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch time
         is 1480615200 seconds, or 58406520 in hexadecimal.

       o A 96-bit identifier for the trace, globally unique, in 24 hexadecimal
         digits.

SYNOPSIS
            put-trace-segments
          --trace-segment-documents <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --trace-segment-documents (list)
          A string containing a JSON document defining one or more segments or
          subsegments.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To upload a segment

       The following put-trace-segments example uploads segment  documents  to
       AWS  X-Ray.  The segment document is consumed as a list of JSON segment
       documents.

          aws xray put-trace-segments \
              --trace-segment-documents "{\"id\":\"20312a0e2b8809f4\",\"name\":\"DynamoDB\",\"trace_id\":\"1-5832862d-a43aafded3334a971fe312db\",\"start_time\":1.479706157195E9,\"end_time\":1.479706157202E9,\"parent_id\":\"79736b962fe3239e\",\"http\":{\"response\":{\"content_length\":60,\"status\":200}},\"inferred\":true,\"aws\":{\"consistent_read\":false,\"table_name\":\"scorekeep-session-xray\",\"operation\":\"GetItem\",\"request_id\":\"SCAU23OM6M8FO38UASGC7785ARVV4KQNSO5AEMVJF66Q9ASUAAJG\",\"resource_names\":[\"scorekeep-session-xray\"]},\"origin\":\"AWS::DynamoDB::Table\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "UnprocessedTraceSegments": []
          }

       For more information, see Sending Trace Data to AWS X-Ray  in  the  AWS
       X-Ray Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       UnprocessedTraceSegments -> (list)
          Segments that failed processing.

          (structure)
              Information about a segment that failed processing.

              Id -> (string)
                 The segment's ID.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error that caused processing to fail.

              Message -> (string)
                 The error message.
