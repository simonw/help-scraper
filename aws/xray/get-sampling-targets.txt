NAME
       get-sampling-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests a sampling quota for rules that the service is using to sample
       requests.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-sampling-targets
          --sampling-statistics-documents <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sampling-statistics-documents (list)
          Information about rules that the service  is  using  to  sample  re-
          quests.

          (structure)
              Request  sampling  results for a single rule from a service. Re-
              sults are for the last 10 seconds unless the  service  has  been
              assigned  a  longer  reporting interval after a previous call to
              GetSamplingTargets .

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the sampling rule.

              ClientID -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the service in hexadecimal.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The current time.

              RequestCount -> (integer)
                 The number of requests that matched the rule.

              SampledCount -> (integer)
                 The number of requests recorded.

              BorrowCount -> (integer)
                 The number  of  requests  recorded  with  borrowed  reservoir
                 quota.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RuleName=string,ClientID=string,Timestamp=timestamp,RequestCount=integer,SampledCount=integer,BorrowCount=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RuleName": "string",
              "ClientID": "string",
              "Timestamp": timestamp,
              "RequestCount": integer,
              "SampledCount": integer,
              "BorrowCount": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To request a sampling quota

       The  following  get-sampling-targets  example requests a sampling quota
       for rules that the service is using to sample  requests.  The  response
       from  AWS  X-Ray includes a quota that can be used instead of borrowing
       from the reservoir.

OUTPUT
       SamplingTargetDocuments -> (list)
          Updated rules that the service should use to sample requests.

          (structure)
              Temporary  changes to a sampling rule configuration. To meet the
              global sampling target for a rule, X-Ray calculates a new reser-
              voir  for  each  service based on the recent sampling results of
              all services that called GetSamplingTargets .

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the sampling rule.

              FixedRate -> (double)
                 The percentage of matching requests to instrument, after  the
                 reservoir is exhausted.

              ReservoirQuota -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  requests per second that X-Ray allocated for
                 this service.

              ReservoirQuotaTTL -> (timestamp)
                 When the reservoir quota expires.

              Interval -> (integer)
                 The number of seconds for the service to wait before  getting
                 sampling targets again.

       LastRuleModification -> (timestamp)
          The last time a user changed the sampling rule configuration. If the
          sampling rule configuration changed since the service last retrieved
          it,  the service should call GetSamplingRules to get the latest ver-
          sion.

       UnprocessedStatistics -> (list)
          Information about SamplingStatisticsDocument that  X-Ray  could  not
          process.

          (structure)
              Sampling statistics from a call to GetSamplingTargets that X-Ray
              could not process.

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the sampling rule.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code.

              Message -> (string)
                 The error message.
