GET-SERVICE-GRAPH()                                        GET-SERVICE-GRAPH()



NAME
       get-service-graph -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a document that describes services that process incoming re-
       quests, and downstream services that they call as a result.  Root  ser-
       vices  process incoming requests and make calls to downstream services.
       Root services are applications that use the Amazon Web  Services  X-Ray
       SDK  .  Downstream  services can be other applications, Amazon Web Ser-
       vices resources, HTTP web APIs, or SQL databases.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-service-graph is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Services

SYNOPSIS
            get-service-graph
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--group-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start of the time frame for which to generate a graph.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the timeframe for which to generate a graph.

       --group-name (string)
          The name of a group based on which you want to generate a graph.

       --group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a group based on which you want to
          generate a graph.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a service graph

       The following example displays a document within a specified  time  pe-
       riod  that  describes  services  processing  incoming requests, and the
       downstream services that they call as a result.:
