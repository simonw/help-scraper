       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-group
          --group-name <value>
          [--filter-expression <value>]
          [--insights-configuration <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          The case-sensitive name of the new group. Default is a reserved name
          and names must be unique.

       --filter-expression (string)
          The filter expression defining criteria by which to group traces.

       --insights-configuration (structure)
          The structure containing configurations related to insights.

          o The InsightsEnabled boolean can be set to true to enable  insights
            for the new group or false to disable insights for the new group.

          o The  NotifcationsEnabled  boolean can be set to true to enable in-
            sights notifications for the new group. Notifications may only  be
            enabled on a group with InsightsEnabled set to true.

          InsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Set  the  InsightsEnabled  value  to  true to enable insights or
              false to disable insights.

          NotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Set the NotificationsEnabled value to true  to  enable  insights
              notifications. Notifications can only be enabled on a group with
              InsightsEnabled set to true.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InsightsEnabled=boolean,NotificationsEnabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InsightsEnabled": true|false,
            "NotificationsEnabled": true|false
          }

       --tags (list)
          A map that contains one or more tag keys and tag values to attach to
          an  X-Ray  group.  For  more information about ways to use tags, see
          Tagging Amazon Web Services resources in  the  Amazon  Web  Services
          General Reference .

          The following restrictions apply to tags:

          o Maximum number of user-applied tags per resource: 50

          o Maximum tag key length: 128 Unicode characters

          o Maximum tag value length: 256 Unicode characters

          o Valid values for key and value: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, space, and the fol-
            lowing characters: _ . : / = + - and @

          o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

          o Don't use aws: as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for Amazon  Web
            Services use.

          (structure)
              A map that contains tag keys and tag values to attach to an Ama-
              zon Web Services X-Ray group or sampling rule. For more informa-
              tion about ways to use tags, see Tagging Amazon Web Services re-
              sources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

              The following restrictions apply to tags:

              o Maximum number of user-applied tags per resource: 50

              o Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

              o Don't use aws: as a prefix for keys; it's reserved for  Amazon
                Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete system tags.

              Key -> (string)
                 A tag key, such as Stage or Name . A tag key cannot be empty.
                 The key can be a maximum of 128 characters, and  can  contain
                 only  Unicode letters, numbers, or separators, or the follow-
                 ing special characters: + - = . _ : /

              Value -> (string)
                 An optional tag value, such as Production or test-only .  The
                 value  can  be  a maximum of 255 characters, and contain only
                 Unicode letters, numbers, or  separators,  or  the  following
                 special characters: + - = . _ : /

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a group

       The  following  create-group example creates a group resource named Ad-
       minGroup. The group gets a filter expression that defines the  criteria
       of the group as a segment related to a specific service causing a fault
       or an error.

          aws xray create-group \
             --group-name "AdminGroup" \
             --filter-expression "service(\"mydomain.com\") {fault OR error}"

       Output:

          {
              "GroupName": "AdminGroup",
              "GroupARN": "arn:aws:xray:us-west-2:123456789012:group/AdminGroup/123456789",
              "FilterExpression": "service(\"mydomain.com\") {fault OR error}"
          }

       Settings with the AWS X-Ray API in the AWS X-Ray Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Group -> (structure)
          The  group that was created. Contains the name of the group that was
          created, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the group that was gener-
          ated based on the group name, the filter expression, and the insight
          configuration that was assigned to the group.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The unique case-sensitive name of the group.

          GroupARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the group generated  based  on
              the GroupName.

          FilterExpression -> (string)
              The filter expression defining the parameters to include traces.

          InsightsConfiguration -> (structure)
              The structure containing configurations related to insights.

              o The  InsightsEnabled  boolean can be set to true to enable in-
                sights for the group or false  to  disable  insights  for  the
                group.

              o The  NotificationsEnabled boolean can be set to true to enable
                insights notifications  through  Amazon  EventBridge  for  the
                group.

              InsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set  the  InsightsEnabled value to true to enable insights or
                 false to disable insights.

              NotificationsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Set the NotificationsEnabled value to true to enable insights
                 notifications.  Notifications  can only be enabled on a group
                 with InsightsEnabled set to true.
