GET-INSIGHT-EVENTS()                                      GET-INSIGHT-EVENTS()



NAME
       get-insight-events -

DESCRIPTION
       X-Ray  reevaluates  insights  periodically  until they're resolved, and
       records each intermediate state as an event.  You  can  review  an  in-
       sight's  events in the Impact Timeline on the Inspect page in the X-Ray
       console.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-insight-events
          --insight-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --insight-id (string)
          The insight's unique identifier. Use the GetInsightSummaries  action
          to retrieve an InsightId.

       --max-results (integer)
          Used to retrieve at most the specified value of events.

       --next-token (string)
          Specify  the  pagination token returned by a previous request to re-
          trieve the next page of events.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InsightEvents -> (list)
          A detailed description of the event. This includes the time  of  the
          event,  client  and root cause impact statistics, and the top anoma-
          lous service at the time of the event.

          (structure)
              X-Ray reevaluates insights periodically until they are resolved,
              and  records each intermediate state in an event. You can review
              incident events in the Impact Timeline on the  Inspect  page  in
              the X-Ray console.

              Summary -> (string)
                 A brief description of the event.

              EventTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in Unix seconds, at which the event was recorded.

              ClientRequestImpactStatistics -> (structure)
                 The  impact  statistics  of the client side service. This in-
                 cludes the number of  requests  to  the  client  service  and
                 whether the requests were faults or okay.

                 FaultCount -> (long)
                     The number of requests that have resulted in a fault,

                 OkCount -> (long)
                     The number of successful requests.

                 TotalCount -> (long)
                     The total number of requests to the service.

              RootCauseServiceRequestImpactStatistics -> (structure)
                 The  impact  statistics  of  the root cause service. This in-
                 cludes the number of  requests  to  the  client  service  and
                 whether the requests were faults or okay.

                 FaultCount -> (long)
                     The number of requests that have resulted in a fault,

                 OkCount -> (long)
                     The number of successful requests.

                 TotalCount -> (long)
                     The total number of requests to the service.

              TopAnomalousServices -> (list)
                 The service during the event that is most impacted by the in-
                 cident.

                 (structure)
                     The service within the service graph that has anomalously
                     high fault rates.

                     ServiceId -> (structure)
                        Name -> (string)

                        Names -> (list)
                            (string)

                        AccountId -> (string)

                        Type -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          Use this token to retrieve the next page of insight events.
