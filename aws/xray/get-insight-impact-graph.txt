GET-INSIGHT-IMPACT-GRAPH()                          GET-INSIGHT-IMPACT-GRAPH()



NAME
       get-insight-impact-graph -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a service graph structure filtered by the specified insight.
       The service graph is limited to only structural information. For a com-
       plete service graph, use this API with the GetServiceGraph API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-insight-impact-graph
          --insight-id <value>
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --insight-id (string)
          The  insight's unique identifier. Use the GetInsightSummaries action
          to retrieve an InsightId.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The estimated start time of the insight, in Unix time  seconds.  The
          StartTime  is inclusive of the value provided and can't be more than
          30 days old.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The estimated end time of the insight, in  Unix  time  seconds.  The
          EndTime  is  exclusive of the value provided. The time range between
          the start time and end time can't be more than six hours.

       --next-token (string)
          Specify the pagination token returned by a previous request  to  re-
          trieve the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InsightId -> (string)
          The insight's unique identifier.

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
          The provided start time.

       EndTime -> (timestamp)
          The provided end time.

       ServiceGraphStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time, in Unix seconds, at which the service graph started.

       ServiceGraphEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The time, in Unix seconds, at which the service graph ended.

       Services -> (list)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  instrumented services related to the in-
          sight.

          (structure)
              Information about an application that processed requests,  users
              that  made  requests, or downstream services, resources, and ap-
              plications that an application used.

              ReferenceId -> (integer)
                 Identifier for the service. Unique within the service map.

              Type -> (string)
                 Identifier for the service. Unique within the service map.

                 o Amazon Web Services Resource - The type of  an  Amazon  Web
                   Services  resource.  For example, AWS::EC2::Instance for an
                   application running on Amazon EC2  or  AWS::DynamoDB::Table
                   for an Amazon DynamoDB table that the application used.

                 o Amazon  Web  Services  Service  - The type of an Amazon Web
                   Services service. For example, AWS::DynamoDB for downstream
                   calls  to Amazon DynamoDB that didn't target a specific ta-
                   ble.

                 o Amazon Web Services Service - The type  of  an  Amazon  Web
                   Services service. For example, AWS::DynamoDB for downstream
                   calls to Amazon DynamoDB that didn't target a specific  ta-
                   ble.

                 o remote - A downstream service of indeterminate type.

              Name -> (string)
                 The canonical name of the service.

              Names -> (list)
                 A  list  of  names  for  the service, including the canonical
                 name.

                 (string)

              AccountId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the Amazon Web Services account  in  which  the
                 service runs.

              Edges -> (list)
                 Connections to downstream services.

                 (structure)
                     The  connection  between two service in an insight impact
                     graph.

                     ReferenceId -> (integer)
                        Identifier of the edge. Unique within a service map.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Pagination token.
