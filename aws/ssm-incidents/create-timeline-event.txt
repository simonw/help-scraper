CREATE-TIMELINE-EVENT()                                CREATE-TIMELINE-EVENT()



NAME
       create-timeline-event -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a custom timeline event on the incident details page of an in-
       cident record. Timeline events are automatically  created  by  Incident
       Manager,  marking  key moment during an incident. You can create custom
       timeline events to mark important events  that  are  automatically  de-
       tected by Incident Manager.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-timeline-event
          [--client-token <value>]
          --event-data <value>
          --event-time <value>
          --event-type <value>
          --incident-record-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the action is called only once with the speci-
          fied details.

       --event-data (string)
          A short description of the event as a valid JSON string. There is no
          other schema imposed.

       --event-time (timestamp)
          The time that the event occurred.

       --event-type (string)
          The type of the event. You can create timeline events of type Custom
          Event .

       --incident-record-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the incident record to  which  the
          event will be added.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              --event-time 2020-10-01T20:30:00.000 \
              --event-type "Custom Event" \
              --incident-record-arn "arn:aws:ssm-incidents::111122223333:incident-record/Example-Response-Plan/6ebcc812-85f5-b7eb-8b2f-283e4d844308"
