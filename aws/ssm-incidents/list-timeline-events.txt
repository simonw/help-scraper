LIST-TIMELINE-EVENTS()                                  LIST-TIMELINE-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-timeline-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists timeline events for the specified incident record.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-timeline-events  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: eventSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-timeline-events
          [--filters <value>]
          --incident-record-arn <value>
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters the timeline events based on the provided  conditional  val-
          ues. You can filter timeline events using the following keys:

          o eventTime

          o eventType

          Note the following when deciding how to use Filters:

          o If  you don't specify a Filter, the response includes all timeline
            events.

          o If you specify more than one filter in a single request,  the  re-
            sponse returns timeline events that match all filters.

          o If you specify a filter with more than one value, the response re-
            turns timeline events that match any of the values provided.

          (structure)
              Filter the selection by using a condition.

              condition -> (structure)
                 The condition accepts before or after a specified time, equal
                 to a string, or equal to an integer.

                 after -> (timestamp)
                     After the specified timestamp.

                 before -> (timestamp)
                     Before the specified timestamp

                 equals -> (structure)
                     The value is equal to the provided string or integer.

                     integerValues -> (list)
                        The list of integer values that the filter matches.

                        (integer)

                     stringValues -> (list)
                        The list of string values that the filter matches.

                        (string)

              key -> (string)
                 The key that you're filtering on.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "condition": {
                "after": timestamp,
                "before": timestamp,
                "equals": {
                  "integerValues": [integer, ...],
                  "stringValues": ["string", ...]
                }
              },
              "key": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --incident-record-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the incident that includes the
          timeline event.

       --sort-by (string)
          Sort by the specified key value pair.

          Possible values:

          o EVENT_TIME

       --sort-order (string)
          Sorts the order of timeline events by the  value  specified  in  the
          sortBy field.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
