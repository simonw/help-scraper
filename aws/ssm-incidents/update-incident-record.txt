              channel of updates to an incident. You can also make updates  to

            customers.

          o 4 - Low impact, customer aren't impacted by the problem yet.

          o 5  - No impact, customers aren't currently impacted but urgent ac-

            {
              "snsTopicArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --status (string)
          The status of the incident. An incident can be Open or Resolved .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
