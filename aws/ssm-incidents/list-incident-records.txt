LIST-INCIDENT-RECORDS()                                LIST-INCIDENT-RECORDS()



NAME
       list-incident-records -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  incident  records  in your account. Use this command to re-
       trieve the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the incident record  you  want
       to update.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-incident-records  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: incidentRecordSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-incident-records
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters the list of incident records through which you  are  search-
          ing. You can filter on the following keys:

          o creationTime

          o impact

          o status

          o createdBy

          Note the following when deciding how to use Filters:

          o If  you don't specify a Filter, the response includes all incident
            records.

          o If you specify more than one filter in a single request,  the  re-
            sponse returns incident records that match all filters.

          o If you specify a filter with more than one value, the response re-
            turns incident records that match any of the values provided.

          (structure)
              Filter the selection by using a condition.

              condition -> (structure)
                 The condition accepts before or after a specified time, equal
                 to a string, or equal to an integer.

                 after -> (timestamp)
                     After the specified timestamp.

                 before -> (timestamp)
                     Before the specified timestamp

                 equals -> (structure)
                     The value is equal to the provided string or integer.

                     integerValues -> (list)
                        The list of integer values that the filter matches.

                        (integer)

                     stringValues -> (list)
                        The list of string values that the filter matches.

                        (string)

              key -> (string)
                 The key that you're filtering on.

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "condition": {
                "after": timestamp,
                "before": timestamp,
                "equals": {
                  "integerValues": [integer, ...],
                  "stringValues": ["string", ...]
                }
              },
              "key": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
