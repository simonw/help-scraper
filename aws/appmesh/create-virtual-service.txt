CREATE-VIRTUAL-SERVICE()                              CREATE-VIRTUAL-SERVICE()



NAME
       create-virtual-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a virtual service within a service mesh.

       A  virtual service is an abstraction of a real service that is provided
       by a virtual node directly or indirectly by means of a virtual  router.
       Dependent  services call your virtual service by its virtualServiceName
       , and those requests are routed to the virtual node or  virtual  router
       that is specified as the provider for the virtual service.

       For more information about virtual services, see Virtual services .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-virtual-service
          [--client-token <value>]
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --spec <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          --virtual-service-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens,  and
          underscores are allowed.

       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to create the virtual service in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If
          the account ID is not your own, then the account  that  you  specify
          must  share the mesh with your account before you can create the re-
          source in the service mesh. For more information about mesh sharing,
          see Working with shared meshes .

       --spec (structure)
          The virtual service specification to apply.

          provider -> (structure)
              The App Mesh object that is acting as the provider for a virtual
              service. You can  specify  a  single  virtual  node  or  virtual
              router.

              virtualNode -> (structure)
                 The virtual node associated with a virtual service.

                 virtualNodeName -> (string)
                     The  name of the virtual node that is acting as a service
                     provider.

              virtualRouter -> (structure)
                 The virtual router associated with a virtual service.

                 virtualRouterName -> (string)
                     The name of the virtual router that is acting as  a  ser-
                     vice provider.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          provider={virtualNode={virtualNodeName=string},virtualRouter={virtualRouterName=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "provider": {
              "virtualNode": {
                "virtualNodeName": "string"
              },
              "virtualRouter": {
                "virtualRouterName": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --tags (list)
          Optional  metadata  that you can apply to the virtual service to as-
          sist with categorization and organization. Each tag  consists  of  a
          key  and  an  optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can
          have a maximum character length of 128 characters,  and  tag  values
          can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

          (structure)
              Optional  metadata  that  you apply to a resource to assist with
              categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key  and
              an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a
              maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag  values  can
              have a maximum length of 256 characters.

              key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --virtual-service-name (string)
          The name to use for the virtual service.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
