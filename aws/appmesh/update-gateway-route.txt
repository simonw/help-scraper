                        way route.

                               prefix, range, regex, suffix.

                            exact -> (string)
                               The value sent by the  client  must  match  the
                               specified value exactly.

                               to match on.

                               end -> (long)

                               start -> (long)
                                   The start of the range.

                            regex -> (string)
                               The  value  sent by the client must include the
                               specified characters.

                            suffix -> (string)
                               The value sent by the client must end with  the
                               specified characters.

                        name -> (string)
                            A  name  for  the HTTP header in the gateway route
                            that will be matched on.

                 hostname -> (structure)
                     The host name to match on.

                     exact -> (string)

                     regex -> (string)
                        The regex used to match the path.

                 port -> (integer)

                 prefix -> (string)
                     Specifies the path to match requests with. This parameter
                     must always start with / , which by  itself  matches  all
                     requests  to the virtual service name. You can also match
                     for path-based routing of requests. For example, if  your
                     virtual service name is my-service.local and you want the
                     route to match  requests  to  my-service.local/metrics  ,
                     your prefix should be /metrics .

                 queryParameters -> (list)
                     The query parameter to match on.

                     (structure)
                        An  object  that represents the query parameter in the
                        request.

                        match -> (structure)
                            The query parameter to match on.

                            exact -> (string)
                               The exact query parameter to match on.

                        name -> (string)
                            A name  for  the  query  parameter  that  will  be
                            matched on.

          priority -> (integer)
              The ordering of the gateway routes spec.

       --virtual-gateway-name (string)
          The name of the virtual gateway that the gateway route is associated
          with.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                               Specify True to match anything except the match
                               criteria. The default value is False .

                        matches  all requests to the virtual service name. You
                        can also match for path-based routing of requests. For
                        example,  if  your  virtual  service  name  is my-ser-
                        vice.local and you want the route to match requests to
                        my-service.local/metrics , your prefix should be /met-
