DESCRIBE-VIRTUAL-SERVICE()                          DESCRIBE-VIRTUAL-SERVICE()



NAME
       describe-virtual-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an existing virtual service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-virtual-service
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --virtual-service-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh that the virtual service resides in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The  AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID
          is not your own, then it's the ID of the  account  that  shared  the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

       --virtual-service-name (string)
          The name of the virtual service to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a virtual service

       The following describe-virtual-service example  returns  details  about
       the specified virtual service.

          aws appmesh describe-virtual-service \
              --mesh-name app1 \
              --virtual-service-name serviceB.svc.cluster.local

       Output:

          {

                          }
                      }
                  },

                      "status": "ACTIVE"
                  },

OUTPUT
       virtualService -> (structure)
          The full description of your virtual service.

          meshName -> (string)
              The name of the service mesh that the  virtual  service  resides
              in.

          metadata -> (structure)
              An object that represents metadata for a resource.

              arn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 created.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 last updated.

              meshOwner -> (string)
                 The  AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the ac-
                 count ID is not your own, then it's the  ID  of  the  account
                 that  shared the mesh with your account. For more information
                 about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .
