OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens, and
          underscores are allowed.

       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh that the route resides in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If
          the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that
          shared the mesh with your account. For more information  about  mesh
          sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

       --route-name (string)
          The name of the route to update.

       --spec (structure)
          The  new  route specification to apply. This overwrites the existing
          data.

                        target  with  a  relative  weight  of 50 receives five

                     cessing  of a request has started and is encountered when
                     the upstream is temporarily or permanently unavailable.

                     (string)

              timeout -> (structure)
                 An object that represents types of timeouts.

                     then make sure that the higher value is set for each  App
                     Mesh  resource  in a conversation. For example, if a vir-
                     tual node backend uses a virtual router provider to route
                     to  another  virtual  node,  then  the  timeout should be
                     greater than 15 seconds for the  source  and  destination
                     virtual node and the route.

                        ing  to their relative weight. For example, a weighted
                        target with a relative  weight  of  50  receives  five
                        times as much traffic as one with a relative weight of
                        10. The total weight for all targets combined must  be

                     must always start with / , which by  itself  matches  all
                     requests  to the virtual service name. You can also match
                     for path-based routing of requests. For example, if  your

                     An  object that represents an idle timeout. An idle time-
                     out bounds the amount of time that a  connection  may  be
                     idle. The default value is none.

                     unit -> (string)
                        A unit of time.

                     value -> (long)

                 perRequest -> (structure)
                     An  object that represents a per request timeout. The de-
                     fault value is 15 seconds. If you set a  higher  timeout,
                     then  make sure that the higher value is set for each App
                     Mesh resource in a conversation. For example, if  a  vir-
                     tual node backend uses a virtual router provider to route
                     to another virtual  node,  then  the  timeout  should  be
                     greater  than  15  seconds for the source and destination
                     virtual node and the route.

                     unit -> (string)
                        A unit of time.

                     value -> (long)

                        weight.  Traffic is distributed across targets accord-
                        ing to their relative weight. For example, a  weighted
                        target  with  a  relative  weight  of 50 receives five
                        times as much traffic as one with a relative weight of
                        10.  The total weight for all targets combined must be

                     must  always  start  with / , which by itself matches all
                     requests to the virtual service name. You can also  match
                     for  path-based routing of requests. For example, if your
                     virtual service name is my-service.local and you want the
                     route  to  match  requests  to my-service.local/metrics ,

       --virtual-router-name (string)
          The name of the virtual router that the route is associated with.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following update-route example uses a JSON input file to update the
       weights for a route.

                            weighted  target  with a relative weight of 50 re-
                            ceives five times as much traffic as  one  with  a
                            relative  weight  of  10. The total weight for all
                            targets combined must be less  than  or  equal  to

                               target.

                            weight -> (integer)

                 match -> (structure)
                     An object that represents the criteria for determining  a
                     request match.

                     metadata -> (list)

                        (structure)
                            An object that represents the match  metadata  for
                            the route.

                            invert -> (boolean)
                               Specify True to match anything except the match
                               criteria. The default value is False .

                            match -> (structure)
                               An object that represents  the  data  to  match
                               from the request.

                               exact -> (string)
                                   The value sent by the client must match the
                                   specified value exactly.

                               prefix -> (string)
                                   The value sent by  the  client  must  begin
                                   with the specified characters.

                               range -> (structure)

                        default value is 15 seconds. If you set a higher time-
                        out,  then  make sure that the higher value is set for
                        each App Mesh resource in a conversation. For example,
                        if  a  virtual  node  backend  uses  a  virtual router
                        provider to route to another virtual  node,  then  the

                            ceives five times as much traffic as  one  with  a
                            relative  weight  of  10. The total weight for all
                            targets combined must be less  than  or  equal  to
