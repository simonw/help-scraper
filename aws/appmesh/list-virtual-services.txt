LIST-VIRTUAL-SERVICES()                                LIST-VIRTUAL-SERVICES()



NAME
       list-virtual-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of existing virtual services in a service mesh.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-virtual-services  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: virtualServices

SYNOPSIS
            list-virtual-services
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to list virtual services in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account  ID
          is  not  your  own,  then it's the ID of the account that shared the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list virtual services

       The  following  list-virtual-services  example lists all of the virtual
       services in the specified service mesh.

          aws appmesh list-virtual-services \
              --mesh-name app1

       Output:

          {
              "virtualServices": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:123456789012:mesh/app1/virtualService/serviceA.svc.cluster.local",
                      "meshName": "app1",
                      "virtualServiceName": "serviceA.svc.cluster.local"
                  },
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:123456789012:mesh/app1/virtualService/serviceB.svc.cluster.local",
                      "meshName": "app1",
                      "virtualServiceName": "serviceB.svc.cluster.local"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value to include in a future ListVirtualServices re-
          quest. When the results  of  a  ListVirtualServices  request  exceed
          limit , you can use this value to retrieve the next page of results.
          This value is null when there are no more results to return.

       virtualServices -> (list)
          The list of existing virtual  services  for  the  specified  service
          mesh.

          (structure)
              An  object  that represents a virtual service returned by a list
              operation.

              arn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the virtual service.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 created.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 last updated.

              meshName -> (string)
                 The name of the service mesh that the virtual service resides
                 in.

              meshOwner -> (string)
                 The  AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the ac-
                 count ID is not your own, then it's the  ID  of  the  account
                 that  shared the mesh with your account. For more information
                 about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

              resourceOwner -> (string)
                 The AWS IAM account ID of the resource owner. If the  account
                 ID  is not your own, then it's the ID of the mesh owner or of
                 another account that the mesh is shared with. For more infor-
                 mation about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

              version -> (long)
                 The version of the resource. Resources are created at version
                 1, and this version is incremented each time that they're up-
                 dated.

              virtualServiceName -> (string)
                 The name of the virtual service.
