NAME
       delete-route -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing route.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-route
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --route-name <value>
          --virtual-router-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to delete the route in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The  AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID
          is not your own, then it's the ID of the  account  that  shared  the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

       --route-name (string)
          The name of the route to delete.

       --virtual-router-name (string)
          The name of the virtual router to delete the route in.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        An  object  that represents a per request timeout. The
                        default value is 15 seconds. If you set a higher time-
                        out,  then  make sure that the higher value is set for
                        each App Mesh resource in a conversation. For example,
                        if  a  virtual  node  backend  uses  a  virtual router
                        provider to route to another virtual  node,  then  the
                        timeout  should  be  greater  than  15 seconds for the
                        source and destination virtual node and the route.

                        unit -> (string)

                            according to their relative weight. For example, a
                            weighted target with a relative weight of  50  re-
                            ceives  five  times  as much traffic as one with a
                            relative weight of 10. The total  weight  for  all
                            targets  combined  must  be  less than or equal to

                        example,  if  your  virtual  service  name  is my-ser-

                        default value is 15 seconds. If you set a higher time-
                        out,  then  make sure that the higher value is set for
                        each App Mesh resource in a conversation. For example,
                        if  a  virtual  node  backend  uses  a  virtual router

                            relative  weight  of  10. The total weight for all
                            targets combined must be less  than  or  equal  to

                        An object that represents a per request  timeout.  The
                        default value is 15 seconds. If you set a higher time-
                        out, then make sure that the higher value is  set  for
                        each App Mesh resource in a conversation. For example,
                        if a  virtual  node  backend  uses  a  virtual  router
                        provider  to  route  to another virtual node, then the
                        timeout should be greater  than  15  seconds  for  the
                        source and destination virtual node and the route.

                        unit -> (string)
                            A unit of time.

                        value -> (long)
                            A number of time units.

              priority -> (integer)
                 The  priority  for the route. Routes are matched based on the
                 specified value, where 0 is the highest priority.

              tcpRoute -> (structure)
                 An object that represents the specification of a TCP route.

                 action -> (structure)
                     The action to take if a match is determined.

                     weightedTargets -> (list)
                        An object that represents the targets that traffic  is
                        routed to when a request matches the route.

                        (structure)
                            An  object  that represents a target and its rela-
                            tive weight. Traffic is distributed across targets
                            according to their relative weight. For example, a
                            weighted target with a relative weight of  50  re-
                            ceives  five  times  as much traffic as one with a
                            relative weight of 10. The total  weight  for  all
                            targets  combined  must  be  less than or equal to
                            100.

                            virtualNode -> (string)
                               The virtual node to associate with the weighted
                               target.

                            weight -> (integer)
                               The relative weight of the weighted target.

                 timeout -> (structure)
                     An object that represents types of timeouts.

                     idle -> (structure)
                        An  object  that  represents  an idle timeout. An idle
                        timeout bounds the amount of time  that  a  connection
                        may be idle. The default value is none.

                        unit -> (string)
                            A unit of time.

                        value -> (long)
                            A number of time units.

          status -> (structure)
              The status of the route.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status for the route.

          virtualRouterName -> (string)
              The virtual router that the route is associated with.



                                                                DELETE-ROUTE()
