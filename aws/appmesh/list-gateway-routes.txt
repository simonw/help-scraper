LIST-GATEWAY-ROUTES()                                    LIST-GATEWAY-ROUTES()



NAME
       list-gateway-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of existing gateway routes that are associated to a vir-
       tual gateway.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-gateway-routes is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: gatewayRoutes

SYNOPSIS
            list-gateway-routes
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --virtual-gateway-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to list gateway routes in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If
          the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that
          shared  the  mesh with your account. For more information about mesh
          sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

       --virtual-gateway-name (string)
          The name of the virtual gateway to list gateway routes in.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       gatewayRoutes -> (list)
          The list of existing gateway routes for the specified  service  mesh
          and virtual gateway.

          (structure)
              An object that represents a gateway route returned by a list op-
              eration.

              arn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the gateway route.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 created.

              gatewayRouteName -> (string)
                 The name of the gateway route.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 last updated.

              meshName -> (string)
                 The name of the service mesh that the resource resides in.

              meshOwner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of  the  service  mesh
                 owner. If the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of
                 the account that shared the mesh with your account. For  more
                 information  about  mesh  sharing,  see  Working  with shared
                 meshes .

              resourceOwner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the resource owner.
                 If  the  account  ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the
                 mesh owner or of another account  that  the  mesh  is  shared
                 with.  For  more  information about mesh sharing, see Working
                 with shared meshes .

              version -> (long)
                 The version of the resource. Resources are created at version
                 1, and this version is incremented each time that they're up-
                 dated.

              virtualGatewayName -> (string)
                 The virtual gateway that  the  gateway  route  is  associated
                 with.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value  to  include in a future ListGatewayRoutes re-
          quest. When the results of a ListGatewayRoutes request exceed  limit
          ,  you can use this value to retrieve the next page of results. This
          value is null when there are no more results to return.
