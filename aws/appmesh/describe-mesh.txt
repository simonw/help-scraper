DESCRIBE-MESH()                                                DESCRIBE-MESH()



NAME
       describe-mesh -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an existing service mesh.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-mesh
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to describe.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The  AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID
          is not your own, then it's the ID of the  account  that  shared  the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a service mesh

       The following describe-mesh example returns details about the specified
       service mesh.

          aws appmesh describe-mesh \
              --mesh-name app1

       Output:

          {
              "mesh": {
                  "meshName": "app1",
                  "metadata": {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:123456789012:mesh/app1",
                      "createdAt": 1563809909.282,
                      "lastUpdatedAt": 1563809909.282,
                      "uid": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                      "version": 1
                  },
                  "spec": {},
                  "status": {
                      "status": "ACTIVE"
                  }
              }
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       mesh -> (structure)
          The full description of your service mesh.

          meshName -> (string)
              The name of the service mesh.

          metadata -> (structure)
              The associated metadata for the service mesh.

              arn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 created.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 last updated.

              meshOwner -> (string)
                 The  AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the ac-
                 count ID is not your own, then it's the  ID  of  the  account
                 that  shared the mesh with your account. For more information
                 about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

              resourceOwner -> (string)
                 The AWS IAM account ID of the resource owner. If the  account
                 ID  is not your own, then it's the ID of the mesh owner or of
                 another account that the mesh is shared with. For more infor-
                 mation about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

              uid -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the resource.

              version -> (long)
                 The version of the resource. Resources are created at version
                 1, and this version is incremented each time that they're up-
                 dated.

          spec -> (structure)
              The associated specification for the service mesh.

              egressFilter -> (structure)
                 The egress filter rules for the service mesh.

                 type -> (string)
                     The  egress filter type. By default, the type is DROP_ALL
                     , which allows egress only from virtual  nodes  to  other
                     defined resources in the service mesh (and any traffic to
                     *.amazonaws.com for Amazon Web Services API  calls).  You
                     can  set  the  egress  filter  type to ALLOW_ALL to allow
                     egress to any endpoint inside or outside of  the  service
                     mesh.

          status -> (structure)
              The status of the service mesh.

              status -> (string)
                 The current mesh status.
