NAME
       create-route -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a route that is associated with a virtual router.

       You can route several different protocols and define a retry policy for
       a route. Traffic can be routed to one or more virtual nodes.

       For more information about routes, see Routes .

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens, and
          underscores are allowed.

       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to create the route in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If
          the  account  ID  is not your own, then the account that you specify
          must share the mesh with your account before you can create the  re-
          source in the service mesh. For more information about mesh sharing,
          see Working with shared meshes .

       --route-name (string)
          The name to use for the route.

                     Mesh  resource  in a conversation. For example, if a vir-
                     tual node backend uses a virtual router provider to route
                     to  another  virtual  node,  then  the  timeout should be
                     greater than 15 seconds for the  source  and  destination

                        ing  to their relative weight. For example, a weighted
                        target with a relative  weight  of  50  receives  five
                        times as much traffic as one with a relative weight of
                        10. The total weight for all targets combined must  be

                     An  object that represents an idle timeout. An idle time-
                     out bounds the amount of time that a  connection  may  be
                     idle. The default value is none.

                     An  object that represents a per request timeout. The de-
                     fault value is 15 seconds. If you set a  higher  timeout,
                     then  make sure that the higher value is set for each App
                     Mesh resource in a conversation. For example, if  a  vir-
                     tual node backend uses a virtual router provider to route
                     to another virtual  node,  then  the  timeout  should  be
                     greater  than  15  seconds for the source and destination
                     virtual node and the route.

                     unit -> (string)
                        A unit of time.

                        weight.  Traffic is distributed across targets accord-
                        ing to their relative weight. For example, a  weighted
                        target  with  a  relative  weight  of 50 receives five
                        times as much traffic as one with a relative weight of
                        10.  The total weight for all targets combined must be

                     requests to the virtual service name. You can also  match
                     for  path-based routing of requests. For example, if your
                     virtual service name is my-service.local and you want the

       --tags (list)
          Optional  metadata  that  you  can apply to the route to assist with
          categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key  and  an
          optional  value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a maxi-
          mum character length of 128 characters, and tag values  can  have  a
          maximum length of 256 characters.

          (structure)
              Optional  metadata  that  you apply to a resource to assist with
              categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key  and
              an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys can have a
              maximum character length of 128 characters, and tag  values  can
              have a maximum length of 256 characters.

              key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --virtual-router-name (string)
          The name of the virtual router in which to create the route. If  the
          virtual  router  is  in a shared mesh, then you must be the owner of
          the virtual router resource.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a new gRPC route

       The following create-route example uses a JSON input file to  create  a
       gRPC  route.  GRPC  traffic  that  has metadata that starts with 123 is
       routed to a virtual node named  serviceBgrpc.  If  there  are  specific
       gRPC,  HTTP,  or  TCP  failures when attempting to communicate with the
       target of the route, the route is retried three times. There  is  a  15
       second delay between each retry attempt.

       To create a new HTTP or HTTP/2 route

       The  following create-route example uses a JSON input file to create an
       HTTP/2  route.  To  create  an  HTTP  route,  replace  http2Route  with
       httpRoute  under  spec.  All HTTP/2 traffic addressed to any URL prefix
       that has a header value that starts with 123 is  routed  to  a  virtual
       node  named  serviceBhttp2.  If there are specific HTTP or TCP failures
       when attempting to communicate with the target of the route, the  route
       is  retried  three times. There is a 15 second delay between each retry
       attempt.

       To create a new TCP route

       The following create-route example uses a JSON input file to  create  a
       TCP route. 75 percent of traffic is routed to a virtual node named ser-
       viceBtcp, and 25 percent of traffic is routed to a virtual  node  named
       serviceBv2tcp. Specifying different weightings for different targets is
       an effective way to do a deployment of a new version of an application.
       You can adjust the weights so that eventually, 100 percent of all traf-
       fic is routed to a target that has the new version of an application.

                        each App Mesh resource in a conversation. For example,
                        if  a  virtual  node  backend  uses  a  virtual router
