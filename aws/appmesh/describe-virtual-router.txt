NAME
       describe-virtual-router -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an existing virtual router.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-virtual-router
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --virtual-router-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh that the virtual router resides in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The  AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account ID
          is not your own, then it's the ID of the  account  that  shared  the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

       --virtual-router-name (string)
          The name of the virtual router to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a virtual router

       The following describe-virtual-router example returns details about the
       specified virtual router.

          aws appmesh describe-virtual-router \
              --mesh-name app1 \
              --virtual-router-name vrServiceB

OUTPUT
       virtualRouter -> (structure)
          The full description of your virtual router.

          meshName -> (string)
              The name of the service mesh that the virtual router resides in.

          metadata -> (structure)
              The associated metadata for the virtual router.

              arn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)

                 The  AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the ac-
                 count ID is not your own, then it's the  ID  of  the  account
                 that  shared the mesh with your account. For more information
