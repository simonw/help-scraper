DELETE-VIRTUAL-NODE()                                    DELETE-VIRTUAL-NODE()



NAME
       delete-virtual-node -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing virtual node.

       You must delete any virtual services that list a virtual node as a ser-
       vice provider before you can delete the virtual node itself.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-virtual-node
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --virtual-node-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to delete the virtual node in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account  ID
          is  not  your  own,  then it's the ID of the account that shared the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

       --virtual-node-name (string)
          The name of the virtual node to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following delete-virtual-node example deletes the specified virtual
       node.

              The associated metadata for the virtual node.

              arn -> (string)

                               idle  timeout  bounds the amount of time that a
                               connection may be idle. The  default  value  is
                               none.

                               unit -> (string)

                               out. The default value is 15  seconds.  If  you
                               set  a  higher timeout, then make sure that the
                               higher value is set for each App Mesh  resource
                               in  a  conversation.  For example, if a virtual
                               node backend uses a virtual router provider  to
                               route to another virtual node, then the timeout
                               should be  greater  than  15  seconds  for  the
                               source  and  destination  virtual  node and the
                               route.

                               An object that represents an idle  timeout.  An
                               idle  timeout  bounds the amount of time that a
                               connection may be idle. The  default  value  is
                               none.

                        stance. Only instances that match all of the specified
