LIST-ROUTES()                                                    LIST-ROUTES()



NAME
       list-routes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of existing routes in a service mesh.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-routes  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: routes

SYNOPSIS
            list-routes
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --virtual-router-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to list routes in.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the account  ID
          is  not  your  own,  then it's the ID of the account that shared the
          mesh with your account. For more information about mesh sharing, see
          Working with shared meshes .

       --virtual-router-name (string)
          The name of the virtual router to list routes in.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list routes

       The following list-routes example lists all of the routes for the spec-
       ified virtual router.

          aws appmesh list-routes \
              --mesh-name app1 \
              --virtual-router-name vrServiceB

       Output:

          {
              "routes": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:123456789012:mesh/app1/virtualRouter/vrServiceB/route/toVnServiceB",
                      "meshName": "app1",
                      "routeName": "toVnServiceB-weighted",
                      "virtualRouterName": "vrServiceB"
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Routes in the AWS App Mesh User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in a future ListRoutes request.  When
          the  results of a ListRoutes request exceed limit , you can use this
          value to retrieve the next page of results. This value is null  when
          there are no more results to return.

       routes -> (list)
          The  list of existing routes for the specified service mesh and vir-
          tual router.

          (structure)
              An object that represents a route returned by a list operation.

              arn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the route.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 created.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 last updated.

              meshName -> (string)
                 The name of the service mesh that the route resides in.

              meshOwner -> (string)
                 The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the  ac-
                 count  ID  is  not  your own, then it's the ID of the account
                 that shared the mesh with your account. For more  information
                 about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

              resourceOwner -> (string)
                 The  AWS IAM account ID of the resource owner. If the account
                 ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the mesh owner or  of
                 another account that the mesh is shared with. For more infor-
                 mation about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

              routeName -> (string)
                 The name of the route.

              version -> (long)
                 The version of the resource. Resources are created at version
                 1, and this version is incremented each time that they're up-
                 dated.

              virtualRouterName -> (string)
                 The virtual router that the route is associated with.
