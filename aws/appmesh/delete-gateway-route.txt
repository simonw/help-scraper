DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing gateway route.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-gateway-route
          --gateway-route-name <value>
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--mesh-owner <value>]
          --virtual-gateway-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-route-name (string)
          The name of the gateway route to delete.

       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to delete the gateway route from.

       --mesh-owner (string)
          The Amazon Web Services IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If
          the account ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the account that
          shared  the  mesh with your account. For more information about mesh
          sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

       --virtual-gateway-name (string)
          The name of the virtual gateway to delete the route from.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
