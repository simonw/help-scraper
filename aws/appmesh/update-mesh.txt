NAME
       update-mesh -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an existing service mesh.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-mesh
          [--client-token <value>]
          --mesh-name <value>
          [--spec <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. Up to 36 letters, numbers, hyphens,  and
          underscores are allowed.

       --mesh-name (string)
          The name of the service mesh to update.

       --spec (structure)
          The service mesh specification to apply.

          egressFilter -> (structure)
              The egress filter rules for the service mesh.

              type -> (string)
                 The  egress  filter  type. By default, the type is DROP_ALL ,
                 which allows egress only from virtual nodes to other  defined
                 resources  in  the service mesh (and any traffic to *.amazon-
                 aws.com for Amazon Web Services API calls). You can  set  the
                 egress  filter  type to ALLOW_ALL to allow egress to any end-
                 point inside or outside of the service mesh.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          egressFilter={type=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "egressFilter": {
              "type": "ALLOW_ALL"|"DROP_ALL"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a service mesh

       The following update-mesh example uses a JSON input file  to  update  a
       service  mesh  to  allow  all  external  egress traffic to be forwarded
       through the Envoy proxy untouched.

          aws appmesh update-mesh \
              --cli-input-json file://update-mesh.json

       Contents of update-mesh.json:

          {
              "meshName": "app1",
              "spec": {
                  "egressFilter": {
                      "type": "ALLOW_ALL"
                  }
              }
          }

       Output:

          {
              "mesh": {
                  "meshName": "app1",
                  "metadata": {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:appmesh:us-east-1:123456789012:mesh/app1",
                      "createdAt": 1563809909.282,
                      "lastUpdatedAt": 1563812829.687,
                      "uid": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                      "version": 2
                  },
                  "spec": {
                      "egressFilter": {
                          "type": "ALLOW_ALL"
                      }
                  },
                  "status": {
                      "status": "ACTIVE"
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       mesh -> (structure)
          An  object that represents a service mesh returned by a describe op-
          eration.

          meshName -> (string)
              The name of the service mesh.

          metadata -> (structure)
              The associated metadata for the service mesh.

              arn -> (string)
                 The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 created.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when the resource was
                 last updated.

              meshOwner -> (string)
                 The AWS IAM account ID of the service mesh owner. If the  ac-
                 count  ID  is  not  your own, then it's the ID of the account
                 that shared the mesh with your account. For more  information
                 about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

              resourceOwner -> (string)
                 The  AWS IAM account ID of the resource owner. If the account
                 ID is not your own, then it's the ID of the mesh owner or  of
                 another account that the mesh is shared with. For more infor-
                 mation about mesh sharing, see Working with shared meshes .

              uid -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the resource.

              version -> (long)
                 The version of the resource. Resources are created at version
                 1, and this version is incremented each time that they're up-
                 dated.

          spec -> (structure)
              The associated specification for the service mesh.

              egressFilter -> (structure)
                 The egress filter rules for the service mesh.

                 type -> (string)
                     The egress filter type. By default, the type is  DROP_ALL
                     ,  which  allows  egress only from virtual nodes to other
                     defined resources in the service mesh (and any traffic to
                     *.amazonaws.com  for  Amazon Web Services API calls). You
                     can set the egress filter  type  to  ALLOW_ALL  to  allow
                     egress  to  any endpoint inside or outside of the service
                     mesh.

          status -> (structure)
              The status of the service mesh.

              status -> (string)
                 The current mesh status.
