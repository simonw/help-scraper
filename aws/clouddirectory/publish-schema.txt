SYNOPSIS
            publish-schema
          --development-schema-arn <value>
          [--minor-version <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          --schema-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --development-schema-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with the  develop-
          ment schema. For more information, see  arns .

       --minor-version (string)
          The minor version under which the schema will be published. This pa-
          rameter is recommended. Schemas have both a major and minor  version
          associated with them.

       --name (string)
          The  new  name  under which the schema will be published. If this is
          not provided, the development schema is considered.

       --schema-version (string)
          The major version under which the schema will be published.  Schemas
          have both a major and minor version associated with them.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PublishedSchemaArn -> (string)
          The ARN that is associated with the published schema. For  more  in-
          formation, see  arns .
