NAME
       list-object-children -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  paginated  list of child objects that are associated with a
       given object.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-object-children
          --directory-arn <value>
          --object-reference <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--consistency-level <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with  the   Direc-
          tory where the object resides. For more information, see  arns .

       --object-reference (structure)
          The reference that identifies the object for which child objects are
          being listed.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child  links  leading to it from the directory root. Use the
              link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the  path.
              Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names are sepa-
              rated by slashes. For more information about paths,  see  Access
              Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an  opaque  string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject.  An  objects  identifier is immutable and no two objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be retrieved in a single  call.  This
          is an approximate number.

       --consistency-level (string)
          Represents  the  manner  and timing in which the successful write or
          update of an object is reflected in a subsequent read  operation  of
          that same object.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Children -> (map)
          Children structure, which is a map with key as the LinkName and  Ob-
          jectIdentifier as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token.
