       detach-typed-link -

DESCRIPTION
       Detaches  a  typed  link from a specified source and target object. For

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detach-typed-link
          --directory-arn <value>
          --typed-link-specifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the directory where  you  want  to
          detach the typed link.

       --typed-link-specifier (structure)
          Used to accept a typed link specifier as input.

          TypedLinkFacet -> (structure)
              Identifies  the  typed  link  facet  that is associated with the
              typed link.

              SchemaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is  associated  with  the
                 schema. For more information, see  arns .

              TypedLinkName -> (string)
                 The unique name of the typed link facet.

          SourceObjectReference -> (structure)
              Identifies the source object that the typed link will attach to.

              Selector -> (string)
                 A  path  selector supports easy selection of an object by the
                 parent/child links leading to it from the directory root. Use
                 the  link  names from each parent/child link to construct the
                 path. Path selectors start with a slash (/)  and  link  names
                 are  separated  by slashes. For more information about paths,
                 see Access Objects . You can identify an object in one of the
                 following ways:

                 o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An  object  identifier  is  an opaque
                   string provided by Amazon Cloud  Directory.  When  creating
                   objects, the system will provide you with the identifier of
                   the created object. An objects identifier is immutable  and
                   no  two objects will ever share the same object identifier.
                   To identify an object with ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectI-
                   dentifier must be wrapped in double quotes.

                 o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

                 o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

          TargetObjectReference -> (structure)
              Identifies the target object that the typed link will attach to.

              Selector -> (string)
                 A  path  selector supports easy selection of an object by the
                 parent/child links leading to it from the directory root. Use
                 the  link  names from each parent/child link to construct the
                 path. Path selectors start with a slash (/)  and  link  names
                 are  separated  by slashes. For more information about paths,

                 o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

          IdentityAttributeValues -> (list)
              Identifies the attribute value to update.

              (structure)
                 Identifies the attribute name and value for a typed link.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The attribute name of the typed link.

                 Value -> (structure)
                     The value for the typed link.

                     StringValue -> (string)
                        A string data value.

                     BinaryValue -> (blob)
                        A binary data value.

                     BooleanValue -> (boolean)
                        A Boolean data value.

                     NumberValue -> (string)
                        A number data value.

                     DatetimeValue -> (timestamp)
                        A date and time value.

       JSON Syntax:

            "TypedLinkFacet": {
              "SchemaArn": "string",

              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
