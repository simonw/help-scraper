CREATE-OBJECT()                                                CREATE-OBJECT()



NAME
       create-object -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an object in a  Directory . Additionally attaches the object to
       a parent, if a parent reference and LinkName is specified. An object is
       simply  a  collection  of   Facet attributes. You can also use this API
       call to create a policy object, if the facet from which you create  the
       object is a policy facet.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-object
          --directory-arn <value>
          --schema-facets <value>
          [--object-attribute-list <value>]
          [--parent-reference <value>]
          [--link-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with the  Direc-
          tory in which the object will be created. For more information,  see
          arns .

       --schema-facets (list)
          A  list  of  schema  facets to be associated with the object. Do not
          provide minor version components. See  SchemaFacet for details.

          (structure)
              A facet.

              SchemaArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the schema that contains the facet with  no  minor
                 component.  See   arns  and In-Place Schema Upgrade for a de-
                 scription of when to provide minor versions. If this value is
                 set, FacetName must also be set.

              FacetName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the facet. If this value is set, SchemaArn must
                 also be set.

       Shorthand Syntax:

            }
            ...
          ]

       --object-attribute-list (list)

                     tains the facet and attribute.

                 StringValue -> (string)
                     A string data value.

                 BinaryValue -> (blob)
                     A binary data value.

                 BooleanValue -> (boolean)
                     A Boolean data value.

                 NumberValue -> (string)
                     A number data value.

                 DatetimeValue -> (timestamp)
                     A date and time value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key={SchemaArn=string,FacetName=string,Name=string},Value={StringValue=string,BinaryValue=blob,BooleanValue=boolean,NumberValue=string,DatetimeValue=timestamp} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": {
                "SchemaArn": "string",
                "FacetName": "string",
                "Name": "string"
              },
              "Value": {
                "StringValue": "string",
                "BinaryValue": blob,
                "BooleanValue": true|false,

            ...
          ]

       --parent-reference (structure)
          If specified, the parent reference to which this object will be  at-
          tached.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child links leading to it from the directory root.  Use  the
              link  names  from  each parent/child link to construct the path.
              Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names  are  sepa-
              rated  by  slashes. For more information about paths, see Access
              Objects . You can identify an object in  one  of  the  following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An object identifier is an opaque string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject. An objects identifier is immutable and  no  two  objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --link-name (string)
          The name of link that is used to attach this object to a parent.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ObjectIdentifier -> (string)
          The identifier that is associated with the object.
