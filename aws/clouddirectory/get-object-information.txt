NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves metadata about an object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-object-information
          --directory-arn <value>
          --object-reference <value>
          [--consistency-level <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The ARN of the directory being retrieved.

       --object-reference (structure)
          A reference to the object.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child links leading to it from the directory root.  Use  the
              link  names  from  each parent/child link to construct the path.
              Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names  are  sepa-
              rated  by  slashes. For more information about paths, see Access
              Objects . You can identify an object in  one  of  the  following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An object identifier is an opaque string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject. An objects identifier is immutable and  no  two  objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --consistency-level (string)
          The consistency level at which to retrieve the object information.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SchemaFacets -> (list)
          The facets attached to the specified object. Although  the  response
          does  not  include  minor version information, the most recently ap-
          plied minor version of each Facet is  in  effect.  See   GetApplied-
          SchemaVersion for details.

          (structure)
              A facet.

              SchemaArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the schema that contains the facet with no minor
                 component. See  arns and In-Place Schema Upgrade  for  a  de-
                 scription of when to provide minor versions. If this value is
                 set, FacetName must also be set.

              FacetName -> (string)
                 The name of the facet. If this value is set,  SchemaArn  must
                 also be set.

       ObjectIdentifier -> (string)
          The ObjectIdentifier of the specified object.
