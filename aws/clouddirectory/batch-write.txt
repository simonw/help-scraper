                        A path selector supports easy selection of  an  object
                        by  the  parent/child links leading to it from the di-
                        rectory root.  Use  the  link  names  from  each  par-
                        ent/child  link  to construct the path. Path selectors
                        start with a slash (/) and link names are separated by
                        slashes.  For more information about paths, see Access
                        Objects . You can identify an object  in  one  of  the

                          will ever share the same object identifier. To iden-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                            parent/child  link to construct the path. Path se-
                            lectors start with a slash (/) and link names  are
                            separated  by  slashes. For more information about

                            o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path
