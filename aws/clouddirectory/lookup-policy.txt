LOOKUP-POLICY()                                                LOOKUP-POLICY()



NAME
       lookup-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all policies from the root of the  Directory to the object speci-
       fied. If there are no policies present, an empty list is  returned.  If
       policies  are  present, and if some objects don't have the policies at-
       tached, it returns the ObjectIdentifier for such objects.  If  policies
       are  present, it returns ObjectIdentifier , policyId , and policyType .
       Paths that don't lead to the root from the target object  are  ignored.
       For more information, see Policies .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       lookup-policy  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PolicyToPathList

SYNOPSIS
            lookup-policy
          --directory-arn <value>
          --object-reference <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with  the   Direc-
          tory . For more information, see  arns .

       --object-reference (structure)
          Reference  that  identifies the object whose policies will be looked
          up.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child  links  leading to it from the directory root. Use the
              link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the  path.
              Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names are sepa-
              rated by slashes. For more information about paths,  see  Access
              Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an  opaque  string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject.  An  objects  identifier is immutable and no two objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PolicyToPathList -> (list)
          Provides list of path to policies. Policies contain PolicyId  ,  Ob-
          jectIdentifier , and PolicyType . For more information, see Policies
          .

          (structure)
              Used when a regular object exists in a  Directory and  you  want
              to find all of the policies that are associated with that object
              and the parent to that object.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path that is referenced from the root.

              Policies -> (list)
                 List of policy objects.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the PolicyType , PolicyId , and the  ObjectIden-
                     tifier to which it is attached. For more information, see
                     Policies .

                     PolicyId -> (string)
                        The ID of PolicyAttachment .

                     ObjectIdentifier -> (string)
                        The ObjectIdentifier that is associated with PolicyAt-
                        tachment .

                     PolicyType -> (string)
                        The type of policy that can be associated with Policy-
                        Attachment .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token.
