SYNOPSIS
            list-object-parents
          --directory-arn <value>
          --object-reference <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--consistency-level <value>]
          [--include-all-links-to-each-parent | --no-include-all-links-to-each-parent]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with  the   Direc-
          tory where the object resides. For more information, see  arns .

       --object-reference (structure)
          The  reference  that  identifies the object for which parent objects
          are being listed.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child  links  leading to it from the directory root. Use the
              link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the  path.
              Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names are sepa-
              rated by slashes. For more information about paths,  see  Access
              Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an  opaque  string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject.  An  objects  identifier is immutable and no two objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to be retrieved in a single  call.  This
          is an approximate number.

       --consistency-level (string)
          Represents  the  manner  and timing in which the successful write or
          update of an object is reflected in a subsequent read  operation  of
          that same object.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --include-all-links-to-each-parent              |              --no-in-
       clude-all-links-to-each-parent (boolean)
          When set to True, returns all  ListObjectParentsResponse$ParentLinks
          . There could be multiple links between a parent-child pair.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Parents -> (map)
          The  parent  structure, which is a map with key as the ObjectIdenti-
          fier and LinkName as the value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token.

       ParentLinks -> (list)
          Returns a list of parent reference and LinkName Tuples.

          (structure)
              A pair of ObjectIdentifier and LinkName.

              ObjectIdentifier -> (string)
                 The ID that is associated with the object.

              LinkName -> (string)
                 The name of the link between the parent and the child object.
