SYNOPSIS
            create-index
          --directory-arn <value>
          --ordered-indexed-attribute-list <value>
          --is-unique | --no-is-unique
          [--parent-reference <value>]
          [--link-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The ARN of the directory where the index should be created.

       --ordered-indexed-attribute-list (list)
          Specifies the attributes that should be indexed on. Currently only a
          single attribute is supported.

          (structure)
              A unique identifier for an attribute.

              SchemaArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  schema  that  contains
                 the facet and attribute.

              FacetName -> (string)
                 The name of the facet that the attribute exists within.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,FacetName=string,Name=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SchemaArn": "string",
              "FacetName": "string",
              "Name": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --is-unique | --no-is-unique (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the  attribute  that is being indexed has unique
          values or not.

       --parent-reference (structure)
          A reference to the parent object that contains the index object.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child  links  leading to it from the directory root. Use the
              link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the  path.
              Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names are sepa-
              rated by slashes. For more information about paths,  see  Access
              Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an  opaque  string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject.  An  objects  identifier is immutable and no two objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --link-name (string)
          The name of the link between the parent object and the index object.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ObjectIdentifier -> (string)
          The ObjectIdentifier of the index created by this operation.
