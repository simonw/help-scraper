LIST-INCOMING-TYPED-LINKS()                        LIST-INCOMING-TYPED-LINKS()



NAME
       list-incoming-typed-links -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a paginated list of all the incoming  TypedLinkSpecifier infor-
       mation for an object. It also supports filtering by  typed  link  facet
       and identity attributes. For more information, see Typed Links .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-incoming-typed-links  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: LinkSpecifiers

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the directory where  you  want  to
          list the typed links.

       --object-reference (structure)
          Reference  that  identifies  the  object  whose  attributes  will be
          listed.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child  links  leading to it from the directory root. Use the
              link names from each parent/child link to  construct  the  path.
              Path  selectors  start with a slash (/) and link names are sepa-
              rated by slashes. For more information about paths,  see  Access
              Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier - An object identifier is an  opaque  string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject.  An  objects  identifier is immutable and no two objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"

       --filter-attribute-ranges (list)
          Provides range  filters  for  multiple  attributes.  When  providing
          ranges to typed link selection, any inexact ranges must be specified
          at the end. Any attributes that do not have a  range  specified  are
          presumed to match the entire range.

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filter-typed-link (structure)
          Filters are interpreted in the order of the attributes on the  typed
          link  facet,  not  the  order  in which they are supplied to any API
          calls.

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  that  is  associated  with  the
              schema. For more information, see  arns .

          TypedLinkName -> (string)
              The unique name of the typed link facet.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,TypedLinkName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "TypedLinkName": "string"
          }

       --consistency-level (string)
          The consistency level to execute the request at.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       LinkSpecifiers -> (list)
          Returns one or more typed link specifiers as output.

          (structure)
              Contains all the information that is used to uniquely identify a
              typed link. The parameters discussed in this topic are  used  to
              uniquely  specify  the  typed  link  being operated on. The  At-
              tachTypedLink API returns a typed link specifier while the   De-
              tachTypedLink  API accepts one as input. Similarly, the  ListIn-
              comingTypedLinks and  ListOutgoingTypedLinks API operations pro-
              vide  typed  link specifiers as output. You can also construct a
              typed link specifier from scratch.

              TypedLinkFacet -> (structure)
                 Identifies the typed link facet that is associated  with  the
                 typed link.

                 SchemaArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that is associated with
                     the schema. For more information, see  arns .

                 TypedLinkName -> (string)
                     The unique name of the typed link facet.

              SourceObjectReference -> (structure)
                 Identifies the source object that the typed link will  attach
                 to.

                 Selector -> (string)
                     A  path  selector supports easy selection of an object by
                     the parent/child links leading to it from  the  directory
                     root.  Use  the link names from each parent/child link to
                     construct the path. Path selectors start with a slash (/)
                     and  link names are separated by slashes. For more infor-
                     mation about paths, see Access Objects . You can identify
                     an object in one of the following ways:

                     o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An object identifier is an opaque
                       string provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When  creat-
                       ing objects, the system will provide you with the iden-
                       tifier of the created object. An objects identifier  is
                       immutable  and  no two objects will ever share the same
                       object identifier. To identify an object with  ObjectI-
                       dentifier, the ObjectIdentifier must be wrapped in dou-
                       ble quotes.

                     o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

                     o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a  batch
                       call

              TargetObjectReference -> (structure)
                 Identifies  the target object that the typed link will attach
                 to.

                 Selector -> (string)
                     A path selector supports easy selection of an  object  by
                     the  parent/child  links leading to it from the directory
                     root. Use the link names from each parent/child  link  to
                     construct the path. Path selectors start with a slash (/)

                       call

              IdentityAttributeValues -> (list)
                 Identifies the attribute value to update.

                 (structure)
                     Identifies the attribute name and value for a typed link.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The attribute name of the typed link.

                     Value -> (structure)
