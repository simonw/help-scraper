OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with the  Direc-
          tory . For more information, see  arns .

       --operations (list)
          A list of operations that are part of the batch.

          (structure)
              Represents the output of a BatchRead operation.

              ListObjectAttributes -> (structure)
                 Lists all attributes that are associated with an object.

                 ObjectReference -> (structure)
                     Reference of the  object  whose  attributes  need  to  be
                     listed.

                     Selector -> (string)
                        A  path  selector supports easy selection of an object
                        by the parent/child links leading to it from  the  di-
                        rectory  root.  Use  the  link  names  from  each par-
                        ent/child link to construct the path.  Path  selectors
                        start with a slash (/) and link names are separated by
                        slashes. For more information about paths, see  Access
                        Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the
                        following ways:

                        o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An  object  identifier  is  an
                          opaque  string  provided  by Amazon Cloud Directory.
                          When creating objects, the system will  provide  you
                          with  the  identifier  of the created object. An ob-
                          jects identifier is immutable  and  no  two  objects
                          will ever share the same object identifier. To iden-
                          tify an object with ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectI-
                          dentifier must be wrapped in double quotes.

                        o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

                        o #SomeBatchReference  -  Identifies  the  object in a
                          batch call

                 NextToken -> (string)
                     The pagination token.

                 MaxResults -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of items to be retrieved in  a  single
                     call. This is an approximate number.

                 FacetFilter -> (structure)
                     Used to filter the list of object attributes that are as-
                     sociated with a certain facet.

                     SchemaArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the schema that contains the facet with  no
                        minor component. See  arns and In-Place Schema Upgrade
                        for a description of when to provide  minor  versions.
                        If this value is set, FacetName must also be set.

                     FacetName -> (string)
                        The name of the facet. If this value is set, SchemaArn
                        must also be set.

              ListObjectChildren -> (structure)
                 Returns a paginated list of child objects that are associated
                 with a given object.

                 ObjectReference -> (structure)
                     Reference of the object for which child objects are being
                     listed.

                     Selector -> (string)

                 list  is  returned.  If policies are present, and if some ob-
                 jects don't have the policies attached, it returns the Objec-
                 tIdentifier for such objects. If policies are present, it re-
                 turns ObjectIdentifier , policyId , and  policyType  .  Paths

                     will be listed.

                     Selector -> (string)
                        A  path  selector supports easy selection of an object
                        by the parent/child links leading to it from  the  di-
                        rectory  root.  Use  the  link  names  from  each par-
                        ent/child link to construct the path.  Path  selectors
                        start with a slash (/) and link names are separated by
                        slashes. For more information about paths, see  Access
                        Objects  .  You  can  identify an object in one of the
                        following ways:

                        o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An  object  identifier  is  an
                          opaque  string  provided  by Amazon Cloud Directory.
                          When creating objects, the system will  provide  you
                          with  the  identifier  of the created object. An ob-
                          jects identifier is immutable  and  no  two  objects
                          will ever share the same object identifier. To iden-
                          tify an object with ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectI-
                          dentifier must be wrapped in double quotes.

                        o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

                        o #SomeBatchReference  -  Identifies  the  object in a
                          batch call

                 FilterAttributeRanges -> (list)
                     Provides range filters for multiple attributes. When pro-
                     viding ranges to typed link selection, any inexact ranges
                     must be specified at the end. Any attributes that do  not
                     have  a  range specified are presumed to match the entire
                     range.

                     (structure)

       --consistency-level (string)
          Represents the manner and timing in which the  successful  write  or
          update  of  an object is reflected in a subsequent read operation of
          that same object.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            ListOutgoingTypedLinks  API   operations   provide
                            typed link specifiers as output. You can also con-
                            struct a typed link specifier from scratch.

                               link will attach to.

                               Selector -> (string)
                                   A path selector supports easy selection  of
                                   an object by the parent/child links leading
                                   to it from the directory root. Use the link
                                   names  from  each parent/child link to con-
                                   struct the path. Path selectors start  with
                                   a slash (/) and link names are separated by
                                   slashes. For more information about  paths,
                                   see  Access  Objects  . You can identify an
                                   object in one of the following ways:

                                   o $ObjectIdentifier - An object  identifier
                                     is  an  opaque  string provided by Amazon
                                     Cloud Directory. When  creating  objects,
                                     the  system  will  provide  you  with the
                                     identifier of the created object. An  ob-
                                     jects  identifier is immutable and no two
                                     objects will ever share the  same  object
                                     identifier.  To  identify  an object with
                                     ObjectIdentifier,  the   ObjectIdentifier
                                     must be wrapped in double quotes.

                                   o /some/path  - Identifies the object based
                                     on path

                                   o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the  ob-
                                     ject in a batch call

                            TargetObjectReference -> (structure)
