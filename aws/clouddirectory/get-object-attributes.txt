NAME
       get-object-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves attributes within a facet that are associated with an object.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-object-attributes
          --directory-arn <value>
          --object-reference <value>
          [--consistency-level <value>]
          --schema-facet <value>
          --attribute-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that is associated with the  Direc-
          tory where the object resides.

       --object-reference (structure)
          Reference that identifies the object whose attributes  will  be  re-
          trieved.

          Selector -> (string)
              A path selector supports easy selection of an object by the par-
              ent/child links leading to it from the directory root.  Use  the
              link  names  from  each parent/child link to construct the path.
              Path selectors start with a slash (/) and link names  are  sepa-
              rated  by  slashes. For more information about paths, see Access
              Objects . You can identify an object in  one  of  the  following
              ways:

              o $ObjectIdentifier  -  An object identifier is an opaque string
                provided by Amazon Cloud Directory. When creating objects, the
                system will provide you with the identifier of the created ob-
                ject. An objects identifier is immutable and  no  two  objects
                will ever share the same object identifier. To identify an ob-
                ject  with  ObjectIdentifier,  the  ObjectIdentifier  must  be
                wrapped in double quotes.

              o /some/path - Identifies the object based on path

              o #SomeBatchReference - Identifies the object in a batch call

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Selector=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Selector": "string"
          }

       --consistency-level (string)
          The  consistency level at which to retrieve the attributes on an ob-
          ject.

          Possible values:

          o SERIALIZABLE

          o EVENTUAL

       --schema-facet (structure)
          Identifier for the facet whose attributes  will  be  retrieved.  See
          SchemaFacet for details.

          SchemaArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the schema that contains the facet with no minor com-
              ponent. See  arns and In-Place Schema Upgrade for a  description
              of  when  to  provide  minor  versions.  If  this  value is set,
              FacetName must also be set.

          FacetName -> (string)
              The name of the facet. If this value is set, SchemaArn must also
              be set.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SchemaArn=string,FacetName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SchemaArn": "string",
            "FacetName": "string"
          }

       --attribute-names (list)
          List of attribute names whose values will be retrieved.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
