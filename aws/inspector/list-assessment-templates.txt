LIST-ASSESSMENT-TEMPLATES()                        LIST-ASSESSMENT-TEMPLATES()



NAME
       list-assessment-templates -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  assessment templates that correspond to the assessment tar-
       gets that are specified by the ARNs of the assessment targets.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-assessment-templates is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: assessmentTemplateArns

SYNOPSIS
            list-assessment-templates
          [--assessment-target-arns <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-target-arns (list)
          A  list  of ARNs that specifies the assessment targets whose assess-
          ment templates you want to list.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filter (structure)
          You can use this parameter to specify a subset of  data  to  be  in-
          cluded in the action's response.

          For a record to match a filter, all specified filter attributes must
          match. When multiple values are specified for  a  filter  attribute,
          any of the values can match.

          namePattern -> (string)
              For  a  record  to match a filter, an explicit value or a string
              that contains a wildcard that is specified for  this  data  type
              property  must  match  the  value  of the assessmentTemplateName
              property of the  AssessmentTemplate data type.

          durationRange -> (structure)
              For a record to match a filter, the  value  specified  for  this
              data  type property must inclusively match any value between the
              specified minimum and maximum values  of  the  durationInSeconds
              property of the  AssessmentTemplate data type.

              minSeconds -> (integer)
                 The minimum value of the duration range. Must be greater than
                 zero.

              maxSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum value of the duration range. Must be less than or
                 equal to 604800 seconds (1 week).

          rulesPackageArns -> (list)
              For  a  record  to match a filter, the values that are specified
              for this data type property must be contained  in  the  list  of
              values  of  the rulesPackageArns property of the  AssessmentTem-
              plate data type.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          namePattern=string,durationRange={minSeconds=integer,maxSeconds=integer},rulesPackageArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "namePattern": "string",
            "durationRange": {
              "minSeconds": integer,
              "maxSeconds": integer
            },
            "rulesPackageArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list assessment templates

       The following list-assessment-templates command lists all existing  as-
       sessment templates:

          aws inspector list-assessment-templates

       Output:

          {
                 "assessmentTemplateArns": [
                 "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-0kFIPusq/template/0-4r1V2mAw",
                 "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-0kFIPusq/template/0-Uza6ihLh"
                 ]
          }

       For more information, see Amazon Inspector Assessment Templates and As-
       sessment Runs in the Amazon Inspector guide.

OUTPUT
       assessmentTemplateArns -> (list)
          A list of ARNs that specifies the assessment templates  returned  by
          the action.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          When  a  response  is generated, if there is more data to be listed,
          this parameter is present in the response and contains the value  to
          use  for the nextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
          If there is no more data to be listed,  this  parameter  is  set  to
          null.
