NAME
       stop-assessment-run -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops the assessment run that is specified by the ARN of the assessment
       run.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-assessment-run
          --assessment-run-arn <value>
          [--stop-action <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-run-arn (string)
          The ARN of the assessment run that you want to stop.

       --stop-action (string)
          An input option that  can  be  set  to  either  START_EVALUATION  or
          SKIP_EVALUATION. START_EVALUATION (the default value), stops the AWS
          agent from collecting data and begins the results evaluation and the
          findings  generation process. SKIP_EVALUATION cancels the assessment
          run immediately, after which no findings are generated.

          Possible values:

          o START_EVALUATION

          o SKIP_EVALUATION

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop an assessment run

       The following stop-assessment-run command stops the assessment run with
       the      ARN      of      arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:tar-
       get/0-nvgVhaxX/template/0-it5r2S4T/run/0-jOoroxyY:

          aws inspector stop-assessment-run --assessment-run-arn arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-nvgVhaxX/template/0-it5r2S4T/run/0-jOoroxyY
