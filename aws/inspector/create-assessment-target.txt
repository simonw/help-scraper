CREATE-ASSESSMENT-TARGET()                          CREATE-ASSESSMENT-TARGET()



NAME
       create-assessment-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  assessment  target using the ARN of the resource group
       that is generated by  CreateResourceGroup . If resourceGroupArn is  not
       specified,  all EC2 instances in the current AWS account and region are
       included in the assessment target. If the service-linked role isnt  al-
       ready  registered,  this  action  also  creates  and  registers  a ser-
       vice-linked role to grant  Amazon  Inspector  access  to  AWS  Services
       needed to perform security assessments. You can create up to 50 assess-
       ment targets per AWS account. You can run up to 500  concurrent  agents
       per  AWS account. For more information, see Amazon Inspector Assessment
       Targets .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-assessment-target
          --assessment-target-name <value>
          [--resource-group-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-target-name (string)
          The user-defined name that identifies the assessment target that you
          want to create. The name must be unique within the AWS account.

       --resource-group-arn (string)
          The ARN that specifies the resource group that is used to create the
          assessment target. If resourceGroupArn is not specified, all EC2 in-
          stances  in  the  current AWS account and region are included in the
          assessment target.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an assessment target

       The  following  create-assessment-target  command creates an assessment
       target named ExampleAssessmentTarget using the resource group with  the
       ARN        of        arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resource-
       group/0-AB6DMKnv:

          aws inspector create-assessment-target --assessment-target-name ExampleAssessmentTarget --resource-group-arn arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-AB6DMKnv

       Output:

          {
              "assessmentTargetArn": "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-nvgVhaxX"
          }

       For more information, see Amazon Inspector Assessment  Targets  in  the
       Amazon Inspector guide.

OUTPUT
       assessmentTargetArn -> (string)
          The ARN that specifies the assessment target that is created.
