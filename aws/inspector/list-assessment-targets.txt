LIST-ASSESSMENT-TARGETS()                            LIST-ASSESSMENT-TARGETS()



NAME
       list-assessment-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  ARNs of the assessment targets within this AWS account. For
       more information about assessment targets, see Amazon Inspector Assess-
       ment Targets .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-assessment-targets  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: assessmentTargetArns

SYNOPSIS
            list-assessment-targets
          [--filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          You can use this parameter to specify a subset of  data  to  be  in-
          cluded in the action's response.

          For a record to match a filter, all specified filter attributes must
          match. When multiple values are specified for  a  filter  attribute,
          any of the values can match.

          assessmentTargetNamePattern -> (string)
              For  a  record  to match a filter, an explicit value or a string
              that contains a wildcard that is specified for  this  data  type
              property  must match the value of the assessmentTargetName prop-
              erty of the  AssessmentTarget data type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          assessmentTargetNamePattern=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "assessmentTargetNamePattern": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list assessment targets

       The  following  list-assessment-targets  command lists all existing as-
       sessment targets:

          aws inspector list-assessment-targets

       Output:

          {
                 "assessmentTargetArns": [
                 "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-0kFIPusq"
                 ]
          }

       For more information, see Amazon Inspector Assessment  Targets  in  the
       Amazon Inspector guide.

OUTPUT
       assessmentTargetArns -> (list)
          A  list  of  ARNs that specifies the assessment targets that are re-
          turned by the action.

          (string)

       nextToken -> (string)
          When a response is generated, if there is more data  to  be  listed,
          this  parameter is present in the response and contains the value to
          use for the nextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination  request.
          If  there  is  no  more  data to be listed, this parameter is set to
          null.
