LIST-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTIONS()                          LIST-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTIONS()



NAME
       list-event-subscriptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the event subscriptions for the assessment template that is
       specified by the ARN of the assessment template. For more  information,
       see  SubscribeToEvent and  UnsubscribeFromEvent .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-event-subscriptions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: subscriptions

SYNOPSIS
            list-event-subscriptions
          [--resource-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the assessment template for which you want  to  list  the
          existing event subscriptions.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list event subscriptions

       The following list-event-subscriptions command lists all the event sub-
       scriptions for the assessment template with the ARN of  arn:aws:inspec-
       tor:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-nvgVhaxX/template/0-7sbz2Kz0:

          aws inspector list-event-subscriptions --resource-arn arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-nvgVhaxX/template/0-7sbz2Kz0

       Output:

          {
                "subscriptions": [
                  {
                        "eventSubscriptions": [
                          {
                                "event": "ASSESSMENT_RUN_COMPLETED",
                                "subscribedAt": 1459455440.867
                          }
                        ],
                        "resourceArn": "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-nvgVhaxX/template/0-7sbz2Kz0",
                        "topicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:exampletopic"
                  }
                ]
          }
