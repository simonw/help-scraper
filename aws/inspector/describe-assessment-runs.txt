NAME
       describe-assessment-runs -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the assessment runs that are specified by the ARNs of the as-
       sessment runs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-assessment-runs
          --assessment-run-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-run-arns (list)
          The ARN that specifies the assessment run that you want to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe assessment runs

       The  following  describe-assessment-run command describes an assessment
       run  with  the  ARN  of   arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:tar-
       get/0-0kFIPusq/template/0-4r1V2mAw/run/0-MKkpXXPE:
