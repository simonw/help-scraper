DESCRIBE-RESOURCE-GROUPS()                          DESCRIBE-RESOURCE-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-resource-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the resource groups that are specified by the ARNs of the re-
       source groups.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-resource-groups
          --resource-group-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-group-arns (list)
          The ARN that specifies the resource group that you want to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe resource groups

       The  following  describe-resource-groups command describes the resource
       group  with  the  ARN  of  arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:re-
       sourcegroup/0-PyGXopAI:

          aws inspector describe-resource-groups --resource-group-arns arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-PyGXopAI

       Output:

          {
                "failedItems": {},
                "resourceGroups": [
                  {
                        "arn": "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:resourcegroup/0-PyGXopAI",
                        "createdAt": 1458074191.098,
                        "tags": [
                          {
                                "key": "Name",
                                "value": "example"
                          }
                        ]
                  }
                ]
          }

OUTPUT
       resourceGroups -> (list)
          Information about a resource group.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a resource group. The resource  group
              defines  a  set of tags that, when queried, identify the AWS re-
              sources that make up the assessment target. This  data  type  is
              used  as the response element in the  DescribeResourceGroups ac-
              tion.

              arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the resource group.

              tags -> (list)
                 The tags (key and value pairs) of the  resource  group.  This
                 data  type  property  is used in the  CreateResourceGroup ac-
                 tion.

                 (structure)
                     This data type is used as one of the elements of the  Re-
                     sourceGroup data type.

                     key -> (string)
                        A tag key.

                     value -> (string)
                        The value assigned to a tag key.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which resource group is created.

       failedItems -> (map)
          Resource  group  details  that cannot be described. An error code is
          provided for each failed item.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Includes details about the failed items.

              failureCode -> (string)
                 The status code of a failed item.

              retryable -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether you can immediately  retry  a  request  for
                 this item for a specified resource.
