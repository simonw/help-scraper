NAME
       describe-rules-packages -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  rules  packages  that  are specified by the ARNs of the
       rules packages.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-rules-packages
          --rules-package-arns <value>
          [--locale <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rules-package-arns (list)
          The ARN that specifies the rules package that you want to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --locale (string)
          The locale that you want to translate a  rules  package  description
          into.

          Possible values:

          o EN_US

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe rules packages

       The following describe-rules-packages command describes the rules pack-
       age with the ARN of arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:758058086616:rulespack-
       age/0-9hgA516p:

          aws inspector describe-rules-packages --rules-package-arns arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:758058086616:rulespackage/0-9hgA516p
