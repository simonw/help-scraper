NAME
       subscribe-to-event -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables the process of sending Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
       notifications about a specified event to a specified SNS topic.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            subscribe-to-event
          --resource-arn <value>
          --event <value>
          --topic-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The ARN of the assessment template that is used during the event for
          which you want to receive SNS notifications.

       --event (string)
          The event for which you want to receive SNS notifications.

          Possible values:

          o ASSESSMENT_RUN_STARTED

          o ASSESSMENT_RUN_COMPLETED

          o ASSESSMENT_RUN_STATE_CHANGED

          o FINDING_REPORTED

          o OTHER

       --topic-arn (string)
          The ARN of the SNS topic to which the SNS notifications are sent.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To subscribe to an event

       The following example enables the process of sending Amazon SNS notifi-
       cations about the ASSESSMENT_RUN_COMPLETED event to the topic with  the
       ARN of arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:exampletopic

          aws inspector subscribe-to-event \
              --event ASSESSMENT_RUN_COMPLETED \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:target/0-nvgVhaxX/template/0-7sbz2Kz0 \
              --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:exampletopic

       This command produces no output.
