DESCRIPTION
       Adds an log pattern to a LogPatternSet .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-log-pattern
          --resource-group-name <value>
          --pattern-set-name <value>
          --pattern-name <value>
          --pattern <value>
          --rank <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-group-name (string)
          The name of the resource group.

       --pattern-set-name (string)
          The name of the log pattern set.

       --pattern-name (string)
          The name of the log pattern.

       --pattern (string)
          The  log  pattern. The pattern must be DFA compatible. Patterns that
          utilize forward lookahead or  backreference  constructions  are  not
          supported.

       --rank (integer)
          Rank  of  the log pattern. Must be a value between 1 and 1,000,000 .
          The patterns are sorted by rank, so we recommend that you  set  your
          highest  priority patterns with the lowest rank. A pattern of rank 1
          will be the first to get matched to a log line. A  pattern  of  rank
          1,000,000 will be last to get matched. When you configure custom log
          patterns from the console, a Low severity pattern  translates  to  a
          750,000  rank.  A  Medium  severity  pattern translates to a 500,000
          rank. And a High severity pattern translates to a 250,000 rank. Rank
          values  less  than  1  or  greater  than  1,000,000 are reserved for
          AWS-provided patterns.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LogPattern -> (structure)
          The successfully created log pattern.

          PatternSetName -> (string)
              The name of the log pattern. A log pattern name can  contain  as
              many  as  30  characters, and it cannot be empty. The characters
              can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the following symbols:
              period, dash, underscore.

          PatternName -> (string)
              The  name  of the log pattern. A log pattern name can contain as
              many as 50 characters, and it cannot be  empty.  The  characters
              can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the following symbols:
              period, dash, underscore.

          Pattern -> (string)
              A regular expression that defines the log pattern. A log pattern
              can  contain  as  many as 50 characters, and it cannot be empty.
              The pattern must be DFA compatible. Patterns that  utilize  for-
              ward lookahead or backreference constructions are not supported.

          Rank -> (integer)
              Rank of the log pattern. Must be a value between 1 and 1,000,000
              . The patterns are sorted by rank, so we recommend that you  set
              your  highest  priority patterns with the lowest rank. A pattern
              of rank 1 will be the first to get matched to a log line. A pat-
              tern  of  rank  1,000,000  will be last to get matched. When you
              configure custom log patterns from the console, a  Low  severity
              pattern  translates to a 750,000 rank. A Medium severity pattern
              translates to a 500,000 rank. And a High severity pattern trans-
              lates to a 250,000 rank. Rank values less than 1 or greater than
              1,000,000 are reserved for AWS-provided patterns.

       ResourceGroupName -> (string)
          The name of the resource group.
