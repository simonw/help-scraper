NAME
       list-log-patterns -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the log patterns in the specific log LogPatternSet .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-log-patterns
          --resource-group-name <value>
          [--pattern-set-name <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-group-name (string)
          The name of the resource group.

       --pattern-set-name (string)
          The name of the log pattern set.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to return in a single call. To re-
          trieve the remaining results, make another call  with  the  returned
          NextToken value.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourceGroupName -> (string)
          The name of the resource group.

       LogPatterns -> (list)
          The list of log patterns.

          (structure)
              An  object  that defines the log patterns that belongs to a Log-
              PatternSet .

              PatternSetName -> (string)
                 The name of the log pattern. A log pattern name  can  contain
                 as many as 30 characters, and it cannot be empty. The charac-
                 ters can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the  following
                 symbols: period, dash, underscore.

              PatternName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the log pattern. A log pattern name can contain
                 as many as 50 characters, and it cannot be empty. The charac-
                 ters  can be Unicode letters, digits, or one of the following
                 symbols: period, dash, underscore.

              Pattern -> (string)
                 A regular expression that defines the log pattern. A log pat-
                 tern  can  contain as many as 50 characters, and it cannot be
                 empty. The pattern must be DFA compatible. Patterns that uti-
                 lize forward lookahead or backreference constructions are not
                 supported.

              Rank -> (integer)
                 Rank of the log pattern.  Must  be  a  value  between  1  and
                 1,000,000  . The patterns are sorted by rank, so we recommend
                 that you set your highest priority patterns with  the  lowest
                 rank. A pattern of rank 1 will be the first to get matched to
                 a log line. A pattern of rank 1,000,000 will be last  to  get
                 matched. When you configure custom log patterns from the con-
                 sole, a Low severity pattern translates to a 750,000 rank.  A
                 Medium  severity  pattern translates to a 500,000 rank. And a
                 High severity pattern translates to a 250,000 rank. Rank val-
                 ues  less  than  1 or greater than 1,000,000 are reserved for
                 AWS-provided patterns.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token used to retrieve the next page of results. This  value  is
          null when there are no more results to return.
