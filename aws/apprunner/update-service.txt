UPDATE-SERVICE()                                              UPDATE-SERVICE()



NAME
       update-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Update  an  App Runner service. You can update the source configuration
       and instance configuration of the service. You can also update the  ARN
       of  the  auto scaling configuration resource that's associated with the
       service. However, you can't change the name or the encryption  configu-
       ration  of  the service. These can be set only when you create the ser-
       vice.

       To update the tags applied to your service, use  the  separate  actions
       TagResource and  UntagResource .

       This  is  an  asynchronous operation. On a successful call, you can use
       the returned OperationId and the  ListOperations call to track the  op-
       eration's progress.

OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the App Runner service that you
          want to update.

       --source-configuration (structure)
          The source configuration to apply to the App Runner service.

          You can change the configuration of the  code  or  image  repository
          that  the service uses. However, you can't switch from code to image
          or the other way around. This means that you must provide  the  same
          structure member of SourceConfiguration that you originally included
          when you created the service. Specifically, you can  include  either
          CodeRepository  or ImageRepository . To update the source configura-
          tion, set the values to members of the structure that you include.

          CodeRepository -> (structure)
              The description of a source code repository.

              You must provide either this member or ImageRepository (but  not
              both).

              RepositoryUrl -> (string)
                 The location of the repository that contains the source code.

              SourceCodeVersion -> (structure)
                 The version that should be used within the source code repos-
                 itory.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of version identifier.

                     For a git-based repository, branches represent versions.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A source code version.

                     For a git-based repository, a branch name maps to a  spe-
                     cific  version. App Runner uses the most recent commit to
                     the branch.

              CodeConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration for building and running  the  service  from  a
                 source code repository.

                 NOTE:
                     CodeConfiguration  is required only for CreateService re-
                     quest.

                 ConfigurationSource -> (string)
                     The source of the App Runner  configuration.  Values  are
                     interpreted as follows:

                     o REPOSITORY   App Runner reads configuration values from
                       the apprunner.yaml file in the source  code  repository
                       and ignores CodeConfigurationValues .

                     o API   App  Runner uses configuration values provided in
                       CodeConfigurationValues and ignores the  apprunner.yaml
                       file in the source code repository.

                 CodeConfigurationValues -> (structure)
                     The  basic configuration for building and running the App
                     Runner service. Use it to quickly launch  an  App  Runner
                     service  without  providing  a apprunner.yaml file in the
                     source code repository (or ignoring the file  if  it  ex-
                     ists).

                     Runtime -> (string)
                        A runtime environment type for building and running an
                        App Runner service. It represents a  programming  lan-
                        guage runtime.

                     BuildCommand -> (string)
                        The command App Runner runs to build your application.

                     StartCommand -> (string)
                        The command App Runner runs to start your application.

                     Port -> (string)
                        The  port that your application listens to in the con-
                        tainer.

                        The environment variables that are available  to  your
                        running  App  Runner  service.  An  array of key-value
                        pairs. Keys with a prefix of AWSAPPRUNNER are reserved
                        for system use and aren't valid.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

          ImageRepository -> (structure)
              The description of a source image repository.

              You  must  provide either this member or CodeRepository (but not
              both).

              ImageIdentifier -> (string)
                 The identifier of an image.

                 For an image in Amazon  Elastic  Container  Registry  (Amazon
                 ECR),  this  is an image name. For the image name format, see
                 Pulling an image in the Amazon ECR User Guide .

              ImageConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration for running the identified image.

                 RuntimeEnvironmentVariables -> (map)
                     Environment variables that are available to your  running
                     App  Runner  service.  An  array of key-value pairs. Keys
                     with a prefix of AWSAPPRUNNER are reserved for system use
                     and aren't valid.

                     key -> (string)

                 StartCommand -> (string)
                     An optional command that App Runner runs to start the ap-
                     plication in the source image. If specified, this command
                     overrides the Docker images default start command.

                 Port -> (string)
                     The  port  that  your  application listens to in the con-
                     tainer.

                     Default: 8080

              ImageRepositoryType -> (string)
                 The type of the image repository. This reflects  the  reposi-
                 tory  provider  and whether the repository is private or pub-
                 lic.

          AutoDeploymentsEnabled -> (boolean)
              If true , continuous integration from the source  repository  is
              enabled  for the App Runner service. Each repository change (in-
              cluding any source code commit or new image  version)  starts  a
              deployment.

              Default:  App  Runner sets to false for a source image that uses
              an ECR Public repository or an ECR repository that's in an  Ama-
              zon  Web Services account other than the one that the service is
              in. App Runner sets to true in all other cases (which  currently
              include  a  source  code  repository  or  a source image using a
              same-account ECR repository).

          AuthenticationConfiguration -> (structure)
              Describes the resources that are needed to  authenticate  access
              to some source repositories.

              ConnectionArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner connection
                 that enables the App Runner service to connect  to  a  source
                 repository. It's required for GitHub code repositories.

              AccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants
                 the App Runner service access to a  source  repository.  It's
                 required  for  ECR image repositories (but not for ECR Public
                 repositories).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update memory size

       The following update-service example updates the  memory  size  of  in-
       stances (scaling units) of an App Runner service to 2048 MiB.

       When  the  call  succeeds,  App  Runner  starts  an asynchronous update
       process.  The Service structure that's returned by  the  call  reflects
       the new memory value that's being applied by this call.

OUTPUT
       Service -> (structure)
          A description of the App Runner service updated by this request. All
          configuration values in the returned Service structure reflect  con-
          figuration changes that are being applied by this request.

          ServiceName -> (string)
              The customer-provided service name.

          ServiceId -> (string)
              An  ID  that  App Runner generated for this service. It's unique
              within the Amazon Web Services Region.

          ServiceArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this service.

          ServiceUrl -> (string)
              A subdomain URL that App Runner generated for this service.  You
              can use this URL to access your service web application.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when  the App Runner service was created. It's in the
              Unix time stamp format.

          UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the App Runner service was last updated  at.  It's
              in the Unix time stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when  the App Runner service was deleted. It's in the
              Unix time stamp format.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the App Runner  service.  These  particular
              values mean the following.

              o CREATE_FAILED   The  service failed to create. To troubleshoot
                this failure, read the failure events and logs, change any pa-
                rameters  that  need to be fixed, and retry the call to create
                the service. The failed service isn't usable, and still counts
                towards  your  service  quota.  When you're done analyzing the
                failure, delete the service.

              o DELETE_FAILED  The service failed to delete and can't be  suc-
                cessfully recovered. Retry the service deletion call to ensure
                that all related resources are removed.

          SourceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The source deployed to the App Runner service. It can be a  code
              or an image repository.

              CodeRepository -> (structure)
                 The description of a source code repository.

                 You  must  provide either this member or ImageRepository (but
                 not both).

                 RepositoryUrl -> (string)
                     The location of the repository that contains  the  source
                     code.

                 SourceCodeVersion -> (structure)
                     The  version  that  should be used within the source code
                     repository.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of version identifier.

                        For a git-based repository,  branches  represent  ver-
                        sions.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A source code version.

                        For  a  git-based  repository, a branch name maps to a
                        specific version. App Runner uses the most recent com-
                        mit to the branch.

                 CodeConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Configuration for building and running the service from a
                     source code repository.

                     NOTE:
                        CodeConfiguration is required only  for  CreateService
                        request.

                     ConfigurationSource -> (string)
                        The source of the App Runner configuration. Values are
                        interpreted as follows:

                        o REPOSITORY  App Runner  reads  configuration  values
                          from  the  apprunner.yaml  file  in  the source code
                          repository and ignores CodeConfigurationValues .

                        o API  App Runner uses configuration  values  provided
                          in  CodeConfigurationValues  and ignores the apprun-
                          ner.yaml file in the source code repository.

                     CodeConfigurationValues -> (structure)
                        The basic configuration for building and  running  the
                        App  Runner  service.  Use it to quickly launch an App
                        Runner service without providing a apprunner.yaml file
                        in the source code repository (or ignoring the file if
                        it exists).

                        Runtime -> (string)
                            A runtime environment type for building  and  run-
                            ning  an  App Runner service. It represents a pro-

                 ImageIdentifier -> (string)
                     The identifier of an image.

                     For an image in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon
                     ECR), this is an image name. For the image  name  format,
                     see Pulling an image in the Amazon ECR User Guide .

                 ImageConfiguration -> (structure)

                        ning App Runner service. An array of key-value  pairs.
                        Keys  with  a  prefix of AWSAPPRUNNER are reserved for
                        system use and aren't valid.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

                     StartCommand -> (string)

                        application  in  the  source image. If specified, this
                        command overrides the Docker images default start com-
                        mand.

                     Port -> (string)
                        The  port that your application listens to in the con-
                        tainer.

                     or public.

              AutoDeploymentsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 If true , continuous integration from the  source  repository
                 is enabled for the App Runner service. Each repository change
                 (including any source  code  commit  or  new  image  version)
                 starts a deployment.

                 Default:  App  Runner  sets  to false for a source image that
                 uses an ECR Public repository or an ECR repository that's  in
                 an  Amazon  Web  Services account other than the one that the
                 service is in. App Runner sets to true  in  all  other  cases
                 (which currently include a source code repository or a source
                 image using a same-account ECR repository).

              AuthenticationConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Describes the resources that are needed to  authenticate  ac-
                 cess to some source repositories.

                 ConnectionArn -> (string)

                     tion that enables the App Runner service to connect to  a
                     source  repository. It's required for GitHub code reposi-
                     tories.

                 AccessRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  IAM  role  that
                     grants  the App Runner service access to a source reposi-
                     tory. It's required for ECR image repositories  (but  not
                     for ECR Public repositories).

              InstanceRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role  that  provides
                 permissions to your App Runner service. These are permissions
                 that your code needs when it calls any  Amazon  Web  Services
                 APIs.

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  encryption  key that App Runner uses to encrypt the service
              logs and the copy of the source repository that App Runner main-
              tains  for the service. It can be either a customer-provided en-
              cryption key or an Amazon Web Services managed key.
