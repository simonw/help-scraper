NAME
       list-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of running App Runner services in your Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-services
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token from a previous result page. Used for a  paginated  request.
          The request retrieves the next result page. All other parameter val-
          ues must be identical to the ones specified in the initial request.

          If you don't specify NextToken , the request retrieves the first re-
          sult page.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to include in each response (result
          page). It's used for a paginated request.

          If you don't specify MaxResults , the request retrieves  all  avail-
          able results in a single response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a paginated listing of App Runner services

       The following list-services example lists all App  Runner  services  in
       the  AWS account. Up to two services are listed in each response.  This
       example shows the first request. The response includes two results  and
       a  token  that  can be used in the next request.  When a subsequent re-
       sponse doesn't include a token, all services have been listed.

OUTPUT
       ServiceSummaryList -> (list)
          A list of service summary information records. In  a  paginated  re-
          quest, the request returns up to MaxResults records for each call.

          (structure)
              Provides summary information for an App Runner service.

              This  type  contains  limited  information  about  a service. It
              doesn't include configuration  details.  It's  returned  by  the
              ListServices action. Complete service information is returned by
              the CreateService , DescribeService , and DeleteService  actions
              using the Service type.

              ServiceName -> (string)
                 The customer-provided service name.

              ServiceId -> (string)
                 An ID that App Runner generated for this service. It's unique
                 within the Amazon Web Services Region.

              ServiceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this service.

              ServiceUrl -> (string)
                 A subdomain URL that App Runner generated for  this  service.
                 You can use this URL to access your service web application.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the App Runner service was created. It's in the
                 Unix time stamp format.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the App Runner service was last  updated.  It's
                 in theUnix time stamp format.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current state of the App Runner service. These particular
                 values mean the following.

                 o CREATE_FAILED  The service failed to create. Read the fail-
                   ure  events and logs, change any parameters that need to be
                   fixed, and retry the call to create the service. The failed
                   service isn't usable, and still counts towards your service
                   quota. When you're done analyzing the failure,  delete  the
                   service.

                 o DELETE_FAILED   The  service  failed to delete and can't be
                   successfully recovered. Retry the service deletion call  to
                   ensure that all related resources are removed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token that you can pass in a subsequent request to get the next
          result page. It's returned in a paginated request.
