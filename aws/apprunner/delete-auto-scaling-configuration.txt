NAME
       delete-auto-scaling-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete  an App Runner automatic scaling configuration resource. You can
       delete a specific revision or the latest  active  revision.  You  can't
       delete a configuration that's used by one or more App Runner services.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-auto-scaling-configuration
          --auto-scaling-configuration-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --auto-scaling-configuration-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner auto scaling con-
          figuration that you want to delete.

          The ARN can be a full auto scaling configuration ARN, or  a  partial
          ARN ending with either
          ``
          .../name `` or
          ``
          .../name  /revision  ``  . If a revision isn't specified, the latest
          active revision is deleted.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To delete the latest active revision of an auto scaling con-
       figuration

       The  following  delete-auto-scaling-configuration  example  deletes the
       latest active revision of an App Runner auto scaling configuration.  To
       delete  the  latest  active  revision,  specify an Amazon Resource Name
       (ARN) that ends with the configuration name, without the revision  com-
       ponent.

       In  the example, two revisions exist before this action. Therefore, re-
       vision 2 (the latest) is deleted.   However,  it  now  shows  "Latest":
       false,  because,  after being deleted, it isn't the latest active revi-
       sion anymore.

          }

       Example 2: To delete a specific revision of an auto scaling  configura-
       tion

       The  following delete-auto-scaling-configuration example deletes a spe-
       cific revision of an App Runner auto scaling configuration.  To  delete
       a specific revision, specify an ARN that includes the revision number.

       In  the example, several revisions exist before this action. The action
       deletes revision 1.

OUTPUT
       AutoScalingConfiguration -> (structure)
          A description of the App Runner auto scaling configuration that this
          request just deleted.

          AutoScalingConfigurationArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of this auto scaling configura-
              tion.

          AutoScalingConfigurationName -> (string)
              The customer-provided auto scaling configuration name. It can be
              used in multiple revisions of a configuration.

          AutoScalingConfigurationRevision -> (integer)
              The  revision  of  this  auto scaling configuration. It's unique
              among all the active configurations ("Status": "ACTIVE"  )  that
              share the same AutoScalingConfigurationName .

          Latest -> (boolean)
              It's set to true for the configuration with the highest Revision
              among all configurations that share the same Name . It's set  to
              false otherwise.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the auto scaling configuration. If the sta-
              tus of a configuration revision is INACTIVE , it was deleted and
              can't  be used. Inactive configuration revisions are permanently
              removed some time after they are deleted.

          MaxConcurrency -> (integer)
              The maximum number of concurrent requests that an instance  pro-
              cesses. If the number of concurrent requests exceeds this limit,
              App Runner scales the service up.

          MinSize -> (integer)
              The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for a
              service. The service always has at least MinSize provisioned in-
              stances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest  of  them
              (provisioned  and  inactive instances) are a cost-effective com-
              pute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You
              pay  for  memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay
              for CPU usage of only the active subset.

              App Runner temporarily doubles the  number  of  provisioned  in-
              stances  during  deployments,  to maintain the same capacity for
              both old and new code.

          MaxSize -> (integer)
              The maximum number of instances that a service scales up to.  At
              most MaxSize instances actively serve traffic for your service.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when the auto scaling configuration was created. It's
              in Unix time stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the auto scaling configuration was  deleted.  It's
              in Unix time stamp format.
