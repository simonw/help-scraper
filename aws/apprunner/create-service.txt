CREATE-SERVICE()                                              CREATE-SERVICE()



NAME
       create-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Create  an App Runner service. After the service is created, the action
       also automatically starts a deployment.

       This is an asynchronous operation. On a successful call,  you  can  use
       the returned OperationId and the ListOperations call to track the oper-
       ation's progress.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --service-name (string)
          A name for the new service. It must be unique across all the running
          App  Runner services in your Amazon Web Services account in the Ama-
          zon Web Services Region.

       --source-configuration (structure)
          The source to deploy to the App Runner service. It can be a code  or
          an image repository.

          CodeRepository -> (structure)
              The description of a source code repository.

              You  must provide either this member or ImageRepository (but not
              both).

              RepositoryUrl -> (string)
                 The location of the repository that contains the source code.

              SourceCodeVersion -> (structure)
                 The version that should be used within the source code repos-
                 itory.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of version identifier.

                     For a git-based repository, branches represent versions.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A source code version.

                     For  a git-based repository, a branch name maps to a spe-
                     cific version. App Runner uses the most recent commit  to
                     the branch.

              CodeConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration  for  building  and  running the service from a
                 source code repository.

                 ConfigurationSource -> (string)
                     The source of the App Runner  configuration.  Values  are
                     interpreted as follows:

                     o REPOSITORY   App Runner reads configuration values from
                       the apprunner.yaml file in the source  code  repository
                       and ignores CodeConfigurationValues .

                     o API   App  Runner uses configuration values provided in
                       CodeConfigurationValues and ignores the  apprunner.yaml
                       file in the source code repository.

                 CodeConfigurationValues -> (structure)
                     The  basic configuration for building and running the App
                     Runner service. Use it to quickly launch  an  App  Runner
                     service  without  providing  a apprunner.yaml file in the
                     source code repository (or ignoring the file  if  it  ex-
                     ists).

                     Runtime -> (string)
                        A runtime environment type for building and running an
                        App Runner service. It represents a  programming  lan-
                        guage runtime.

                     BuildCommand -> (string)
                        The command App Runner runs to build your application.

                        The command App Runner runs to start your application.

                     Port -> (string)
                        The  port that your application listens to in the con-
                        tainer.

                        The environment variables that are available  to  your
                        running  App  Runner  service.  An  array of key-value
                        pairs. Keys with a prefix of AWSAPPRUNNER are reserved
                        for system use and aren't valid.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (string)

          ImageRepository -> (structure)
              The description of a source image repository.

              You  must  provide either this member or CodeRepository (but not
              both).

              ImageIdentifier -> (string)
                 The identifier of an image.

                 For an image in Amazon  Elastic  Container  Registry  (Amazon
                 ECR),  this  is an image name. For the image name format, see
                 Pulling an image in the Amazon ECR User Guide .

              ImageConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration for running the identified image.

                 RuntimeEnvironmentVariables -> (map)
                     Environment variables that are available to your  running
                     App  Runner  service.  An  array of key-value pairs. Keys
                     with a prefix of AWSAPPRUNNER are reserved for system use
                     and aren't valid.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 StartCommand -> (string)
                     An optional command that App Runner runs to start the ap-
                     plication in the source image. If specified, this command
                     overrides the Docker images default start command.

                 Port -> (string)
                     The  port  that  your  application listens to in the con-
                     tainer.

                     Default: 8080

              ImageRepositoryType -> (string)
                 The type of the image repository. This reflects  the  reposi-
                 tory  provider  and whether the repository is private or pub-
                 lic.

          AutoDeploymentsEnabled -> (boolean)
              If true , continuous integration from the source  repository  is
              enabled  for the App Runner service. Each repository change (in-
              cluding any source code commit or new image  version)  starts  a
              deployment.

              Default:  App  Runner sets to false for a source image that uses
              an ECR Public repository or an ECR repository that's in an  Ama-
              zon  Web Services account other than the one that the service is
              in. App Runner sets to true in all other cases (which  currently
              include  a  source  code  repository  or  a source image using a
              same-account ECR repository).

          AuthenticationConfiguration -> (structure)
              Describes the resources that are needed to  authenticate  access
              to some source repositories.

              ConnectionArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner connection
                 that enables the App Runner service to connect  to  a  source
                 repository. It's required for GitHub code repositories.

              AccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants
                 the App Runner service access to a  source  repository.  It's
                 required  for  ECR image repositories (but not for ECR Public
                 repositories).

          fault auto scaling configuration.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Service -> (structure)
          A description of the App Runner service that's created by  this  re-
          quest.

          ServiceName -> (string)
              The customer-provided service name.

          ServiceId -> (string)
              An  ID  that  App Runner generated for this service. It's unique
              within the Amazon Web Services Region.

          ServiceArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this service.

          ServiceUrl -> (string)
              A subdomain URL that App Runner generated for this service.  You
              can use this URL to access your service web application.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when  the App Runner service was created. It's in the
              Unix time stamp format.

          UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the App Runner service was last updated  at.  It's
              in the Unix time stamp format.

          DeletedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when  the App Runner service was deleted. It's in the
              Unix time stamp format.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the App Runner  service.  These  particular
              values mean the following.

              o CREATE_FAILED   The  service failed to create. To troubleshoot
                this failure, read the failure events and logs, change any pa-
                rameters  that  need to be fixed, and retry the call to create
                the service. The failed service isn't usable, and still counts
                towards  your  service  quota.  When you're done analyzing the
                failure, delete the service.

              o DELETE_FAILED  The service failed to delete and can't be  suc-
                cessfully recovered. Retry the service deletion call to ensure
                that all related resources are removed.

          SourceConfiguration -> (structure)
              The source deployed to the App Runner service. It can be a  code
              or an image repository.

              CodeRepository -> (structure)
                 The description of a source code repository.

                 You  must  provide either this member or ImageRepository (but
                 not both).

                 RepositoryUrl -> (string)
                     The location of the repository that contains  the  source
                     code.

                 SourceCodeVersion -> (structure)
                     The  version  that  should be used within the source code
                     repository.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of version identifier.

                        For a git-based repository,  branches  represent  ver-
                        sions.

                     Value -> (string)
                        A source code version.

                        For  a  git-based  repository, a branch name maps to a
                        specific version. App Runner uses the most recent com-
                        mit to the branch.

                 CodeConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Configuration for building and running the service from a
                     source code repository.

                     ConfigurationSource -> (string)
                        The source of the App Runner configuration. Values are
                        interpreted as follows:

                        o REPOSITORY   App  Runner  reads configuration values
                          from the apprunner.yaml  file  in  the  source  code
                          repository and ignores CodeConfigurationValues .

                        o API   App  Runner uses configuration values provided
                          in CodeConfigurationValues and ignores  the  apprun-
                          ner.yaml file in the source code repository.

                     CodeConfigurationValues -> (structure)
                        The  basic  configuration for building and running the
                        App Runner service. Use it to quickly  launch  an  App
                        Runner service without providing a apprunner.yaml file
                        in the source code repository (or ignoring the file if
                        it exists).

                        Runtime -> (string)

                 uses  an ECR Public repository or an ECR repository that's in
                 an Amazon Web Services account other than the  one  that  the
                 service  is  in.  App  Runner sets to true in all other cases
                 (which currently include a source code repository or a source
