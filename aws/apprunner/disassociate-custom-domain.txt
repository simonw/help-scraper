DISASSOCIATE-CUSTOM-DOMAIN()                      DISASSOCIATE-CUSTOM-DOMAIN()



NAME
       disassociate-custom-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociate a custom domain name from an App Runner service.

       Certificates  tracking domain validity are associated with a custom do-
       main and are stored in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) .  These  certifi-
       cates aren't deleted as part of this action. App Runner delays certifi-
       cate deletion for 30 days after a domain  is  disassociated  from  your
       service.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-custom-domain
          --service-arn <value>
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the App Runner service that you
          want to disassociate a custom domain name from.

       --domain-name (string)
          The domain name that you want to disassociate from  the  App  Runner
          service.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disassociate a domain name from a service

       The following disassociate-custom-domain example disassociates the  do-
       main  example.com from an App Runner service.  The call also disassoci-
       ates the subdomain www.example.com that was  associated  together  with
       the root domain.

OUTPUT
       DNSTarget -> (string)

          A description of the domain name that's being disassociated.

          DomainName -> (string)
              An  associated  custom  domain endpoint. It can be a root domain
              (for example, example.com ), a subdomain (for example, login.ex-
              ample.com or admin.login.example.com ), or a wildcard (for exam-
